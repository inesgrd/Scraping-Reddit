No posts that acknowledge or relate specifically to another post.

Do not post something that has been submitted anywhere on reddit before (including here), even if you were the one who posted it.

**Rule 4** 

**a.** No gifs, videos, or websites.

**b.** All submissions must be original content. If you didn't take the photo, don't post it.

**c.** Overlaid text, arrows, scribbles, and other substantive edits are not allowed.

**d.** No albums.

**Rule 5** 

No screenshots. We define a screenshot as a screen grab. Try /r/screenshots!.
