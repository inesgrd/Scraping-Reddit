It\u2019s melancholy, wistful, and sets the tone and major themes for the book very well.

And she had a daughter who grew up speaking only English and swallowing more Coca-Cola than sorrow. For a long time now the woman had wanted to give her daughter the single swan feather and tell her, \u2018This feather may look worthless, but it comes from afar and carries with it all my good intentions.\u2019 And she waited, year after year, for the day she could tell her daughter this in perfect American English.\u201d", "votes": "161", "comments": "18 commentaires"}, {"title": "I am reading Lolita and it is a book that I don\u2019t love nor would recommend to anyone.

So this opinion isn\u2019t with the full context of the book just what I have read so far. This book beautiful and disgusting. The actual prose are jaw dropingly amazing. Nabokov writes better than any English writer in my opinion. But the writing is talking about truly repugnant things and events. \u201cThe dimmest of my pollution dreams was a thousand times more dazzling than all the adultery the most virile writer of genius or the most talented impotent might imagine\u201d(18). A truly remarkable line talking about how the main characters desires lie in Nymphets as he calls them. The book is both so magnificent to read and makes me want to puke.
