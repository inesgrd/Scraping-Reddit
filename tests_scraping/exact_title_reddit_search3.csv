This week, we move on to special elections in Pennsylvania! Updated 5-3-23 Join r/VoteDEM for more!","Join our new subreddit, r/VoteDEM, to learn more!

Yesterday was a good day for local elections.  A township clerk in Michigan, who was an election denier, lost her recall election in a Trump +52 township, the mayorship of Easton, Maryland, flipped, in the process defeating a 20 year republican incumbent, and democrats held the Lincoln, Nebraska, mayorship and city council!  

This month is a busy one for elections!  In Pennsylvania, we have primaries for local elections and statewide judicial elections, as well as two special elections that will determine if we keep the majority in the State House!

The biggest negative I see is that she isn’t very establishment; I think the RNC might need some convincing to get behind Stefanik.

Tim Scott: I think he MIGHT be able to moderately help Trump among every single voter group. I personally believe the biggest hurdle with a Trump/Scott ticket is that Tim is not married and has no children. It could potentially be hard to portray the traditional familial outlook that Republicans love doing.

Kim Reynolds: She might be good to appeal to women, specifically suburban women in crucial swing states. Although, her record as Iowa governor (certain bills she’s signed) might be a turnoff to some undecided voters. The biggest negative I see with Kim she is kind of boring…which might be just what Republicans need in 2024.

Many political strategists and commentators have pointed to a presidential campaign as the logical next step. Often arguing he has the following to oust former president Donald Trump. 
How would a campaign from Carlson work leading up to election season? 
Does his abrupt departure for Fox work in his favor? If so, why?

85% - Challenges woke ideas
66% - Oppose any gun restrictions
61% - Say Trump won
57% - Make liberals ""angry"" 

Obviously, combating ""wokeness"" is overwhelmingly the most agreeable issue to primary voters, which makes sense considering how popular the topic is on the right and guns have always been a top issue. I was surprised by the others though. Do you agree that ""making liberals angry"" and asserting that Trump won in 2020 even though he didn't are important issues? What policies would you prefer to see as the main motivators for primary voters and why do you think those policies are not higher priority compared to culture war initiatives?

DeSantis 2024: My Opinion

The 2024 Republican presidential primary is shaping up to be a two-man race between former President Donald Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. Both men are popular with the Republican base, but they have very different strengths and weaknesses.

Trump is a proven winner, having won the presidency in 2016. He is also a master of media manipulation and has a strong following among conservative voters. However, Trump is also a divisive figure who has been accused of inciting the January 6th attack on the Capitol.

DeSantis is a rising star in the Republican Party. He is seen as a more moderate alternative to Trump and has been praised for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in Florida. However, DeSantis is also a controversial figure who has been accused of being autocratic and of suppressing dissent.

So, who will win the 2024 Republican presidential primary? It is still too early to say for sure, but I believe that DeSantis has a good chance of defeating Trump.

Here are three reasons why I believe DeSantis has a good chance of defeating Trump:

DeSantis is seen as a more moderate alternative to Trump. Many Republicans are tired of Trump's divisive rhetoric and his attacks on the media and the Republican establishment. DeSantis, on the other hand, is seen as a more moderate alternative who can appeal to a broader range of voters.

DeSantis has a strong record as governor of Florida. DeSantis has been praised for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in Florida, which has been one of the most successful states in the country in terms of reopening and economic recovery. DeSantis has also been praised for his conservative policies, such as his ban on sanctuary cities and his support for school choice.

DeSantis is a rising star in the Republican Party. DeSantis is seen as a rising star in the Republican Party and is popular with young voters and grassroots activists. He has also been endorsed by several prominent Republicans, such as former Vice President Mike Pence and former House Speaker Paul Ryan.

Of course, there are also some reasons why Trump could still win the 2024 Republican presidential primary. Trump still has a very strong following among the Republican base, and he is a very effective fundraiser. However, I believe that DeSantis has a good chance of defeating Trump in the primary. He is seen as a more moderate alternative, he has a strong record as governor of Florida, and he is a rising star in the Republican Party.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgressiveDemocrats/comments/135xy9l/as_someone_who_views_themself_as_being_centerleft/,1,1,0,self.ProgressiveDemocrats,FarPiano9575

The 2022 Midterm Election is the most important midterm of our lifetime.Democrats must behave as if our lives depend on this midterm, because our future depends on the outcome.

”We the people” must deny the Republican party political power at every level of government for decades to come “in order to create a more perfect union.” With 48 States having some statewide contest(s), November 8th, 2022 is our best chance the Democrats will get to do that for the rest of this decade, at least.

”The List” encourages the election of a Democratic Supermajority in the US Senate in 2022. This is the best chance we will have to create a Democratic Supermajority in both Chambers of Congress for the remainder of this decade. This midterm could be a devastating loss for the democrats if good patriots ignore this election. If Americans of good conscience band together instead, we could could begin the exile of the Republican party from power, not for years, but for decades to come.

“The List” is a set of suggestions about where to focus collective activism today.

The election of Democratic Supermajorities to both chambers of the US Congress is the best outcome we can strive towards in the 2022 Midterm Election for many reasons. Among them: breaking the decade of gridlock in Congress, supporting President Biden’s agenda, and his re-election in 2024. My personal favorite is that this could commence the decades-long political banishment of the GOP from power, which the Republican Party so richly deserves.

The Republican party has proved itself treasonous on many levels. They are traitors to Humanity by supporting Trump. Traitors to the Nation for supporting Putin. Traitors to the government and betrayers of the constitution through their apologies for the 1/6/21 insurrection. To safeguard our country and the world, we must block the Republicans from power at the ballot box, at all levels of government, for at least a generation.

Political game playing may be inevitable among humans. Change the numbers, and then change the rules, if not the game. Cynical refusal to play at this time in history cedes power to NAZIs manipulated by Active Measures. That is a surrender to crypto fascism, not radical thinking, mere cynicism, or hipsterism.

In 2022, Patriots must unify to crush the Republican Party at the ballot box. We can defeat them in every State, at every level. We need the biggest turnout at the voting booth of any Midterm ever. We need to raise more money for candidates and organizations than we did during the entire 2020 campaign season if we are to accomplish this. We need to do this in the next six months.

This is what a “Blue Tsunami” REALLY looks like.

Electing a Democratic Supermajority in Congress is our hope for the future and retribution for America’s enemies. “22 Blue in 2022” is a roadmap to the beginning of that journey. “22 Blue in 2022” is our war plan. ”22 Blue in 2022” is our electoral battle cry. “22 Blue in 2022” is a way forward out of gridlock, a way to non-violently thwart those who would poison the body politic with their hate.

If we don’t try this hard in 2022, Trump will go unpunished and metastasize by 2024.

Resist In Power, my sisters, my brothers, and my others.

Resist Together, and elect a Congressional Supermajority in 2022!

There are a few reasons to think that President Biden might lose his bid for re-election next year, even if Donald Trump is once more — for the third straight time — the Republican nominee.

There’s the Electoral College, which could still favor the Republican Party just enough to give Trump 270 electoral votes, even if he doesn’t win a popular majority. There’s Biden’s overall standing — around 43 percent of Americans approve of his job performance — which doesn’t compare favorably with past incumbents who did win re-election. There’s the economy, which may hit a downturn between now and next November. And even if it doesn’t, Biden will still have presided over the highest inflation rate since the 1980s. Lastly, there’s Biden himself. The oldest person ever elected president, next year he will be — at 81 — the oldest president to ever stand for re-election. Biden’s age is a real risk that could suddenly become a liability.

If Biden has potential weaknesses, however, it is also true that he doesn’t lack for real advantages. Along with low unemployment, there’s been meaningful economic growth, and he can point to significant legislative accomplishments. The Democratic Party is behind him; he has no serious rivals for the nomination.

But Biden’s biggest advantage has to do with the opposition — the Republican Party has gotten weird.

It’s not just that Republican policies are well outside the mainstream, but that the party itself has tipped over into something very strange.

I had this thought while watching a clip of Ron DeSantis speak from a lectern to an audience we can’t see. In the video, which his press team highlighted on Twitter, DeSantis decries the “woke mind virus,” which he calls “a form of cultural Marxism that tries to divide us based on identity politics.”

Now, I can follow this as a professional internet user and political observer. I know that “woke mind virus” is a term of art for the (condescending and misguided) idea that progressive views on race and gender are an outside contagion threatening the minds of young people who might otherwise reject structural explanations of racial inequality and embrace a traditional vision of the gender binary. I know that “cultural Marxism” is a right-wing buzzword meant to sound scary and imposing.

DeSantis is a regular offender when it comes to speaking in the jargon of culture war-obsessed conservatives, but he’s not the only one. And it’s not just a problem of jargon. Republican politicians — from presidential contenders to anonymous state legislators — are monomaniacally focused on banning books, fighting “wokeness” and harassing transgender people. Some Republicans are even still denying the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election, doubling down on the election-related conspiracies that hobbled many Republican candidates in the midterms.

Not only do Americans not care about the various Republican obsessions — in a recent Fox News poll 1 percent of respondents said “wokeness” was “the most important issue facing the country today” — but a large majority say that those obsessions have gone too far. According to Fox, 60 percent of Americans said “book banning by school boards” was a major problem. Fifty-seven percent said the same for political attacks on families with transgender children.

It is not for nothing that in Biden’s first TV ad of the 2024 campaign, he took specific aim at conservative book bans as a threat to freedom and American democracy.

And yet there’s no sign that Republicans will relent and shift focus. Just the opposite, in fact; the party is poised to lurch even further down the road of its alienating preoccupations. On abortion, for example, Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, says candidates need to address the issue “head on” in 2024 — that they can’t be “uncomfortable” on the issue and need to say “I’m proud to be pro-life.”


But the Republican Party has veered quite far from most Americans on abortion rights, and in a contested race for the presidential nomination, a “head-on” focus will possibly mean a fight over which candidate can claim the most draconian abortion views and policy aims.

There’s more: DeSantis is in the midst of a legal battle with Disney, one of the most beloved companies on the planet, and House Republicans are threatening the global economy in order to pass a set of deeply unpopular spending cuts to widely used assistance programs.

Taken together, it’s as if the Republican Party has committed itself to being as off-putting as possible to as many Americans as possible. That doesn’t mean the Republican Party is doomed, of course. But as of this moment, it is hard to say it’s on the road to political success.

As for Joe Biden? The current state of the Republican Party only strengthens his most important political asset — his normalcy. He promised, in 2020, that he would be a normal president. And he is promising, for 2024, to continue to serve as a normal president. Normal isn’t fun and normal isn’t exciting. But normal has already won one election, and I won’t be surprised if it wins another",https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakingPoints/comments/135ji73/woke_mind_virus/,6,163,0,self.BreakingPoints,EnigmaFilms

**(NASDAQ:IEP)**

* Icahn Enterprises (IEP) is an \~$18 billion market cap holding company run by corporate raider and activist investor Carl Icahn, who, along with his son Brett, own approximately 85% of the company.
* Our research has found that IEP units are inflated by 75%+ due to 3 key reasons: (1) IEP trades at a 218% premium to its last reported net asset value (NAV), vastly higher than all comparables (2) we've uncovered clear evidence of inflated valuation marks for IEP's less liquid and private assets (3) the company has suffered additional performance losses year to date following its last disclosure.
* Most closed-end holding companies trade around or at a discount to their NAVs. For comparison, vehicles run by other star managers, like Dan Loeb’s Third Point and Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square, trade at *discounts*of 14% and 35% to NAV, respectively.
* We further compared IEP to all 526 U.S.-based closed end funds (CEFs) in Bloomberg’s database. Icahn Enterprises’ premium to NAV was higher than all of them and more than double the next highest we found.
* A reason for IEP’s extreme premium to NAV, based on a review of retail investor-oriented media, is that average investors are attracted to (a) IEP’s large dividend yield and (b) the prospect of investing alongside Wall Street legend Carl Icahn. Institutional investors have virtually no ownership in IEP.
* Icahn Enterprises’ current dividend yield is \~15.8%, making it the highest dividend yield of any U.S. large cap company by far, with the next closest at \~9.9%.
* As a result of the company’s elevated unit price, its current annual dividend rate equates to an absurd 50.5% of indicative net asset value.
* The company’s outlier dividend is made possible (for now) because Carl Icahn owns roughly 85% of IEP and has been largely taking dividends in units (instead of cash), reducing the overall cash outlay required to meet the dividend payment for remaining unitholders.
* The dividend is entirely *unsupported* by IEP’s cash flow and investment performance, which has been negative for years. IEP’s investment portfolio has lost \~53% since 2014. The company’s free cash flow figures show IEP has cumulatively burned \~$4.9 billion over the same period.
* Despite its negative financial performance, IEP has raised its dividend 3 times since 2014. IEP’s most recent dividend increase came in 2019, when it raised quarterly distributions from $1.75 to $2.00 per unit. IEP’s free cash flow was negative $1.7 billion in the same year.
* Given that the investment and operating performance of IEP has burned billions in capital, the company has been forced to support its dividend using regular open market sales of IEP units through at-the-market (ATM) offerings, totaling $1.7 billion since 2019.
* In brief, Icahn has been using money taken in from new investors to pay out dividends to old investors. Such ponzi-like economic structures are sustainable only to the extent that new money is willing to risk being the last one “holding the bag”.
* Supporting this structure is Jefferies, the only large investment bank with research coverage on IEP. It has continuously placed a “buy” rating on IEP units. In one of the worst cases of sell-side research malpractice we’ve seen, Jefferies’ research assumes in all cases, *even in its bear case*, that IEP’s dividend will be safe “into perpetuity”, despite providing no support for that assumption.
* Since 2019, one bank has run all of IEP’s $1.7 billion in ATM offerings: Jefferies. In essence, Jefferies is luring in retail investors through its research arm under the guise of IEP’s ‘safe’ dividend, while *also* selling billions in IEP units through its investment banking arm to support the very same dividend.
* Adding to evidence of IEP’s unsustainability, we estimate that IEP’s last reported indicative year-end NAV of $5.6 billion is inflated by at least 22%, due to a combination of overly aggressive marks on IEP’s less liquid/private investments and continued year to date underperformance.
* In one example, IEP owns 90% of a publicly traded meat packaging business that it valued at $243 million at year-end. The company had a market value of only $89 million at the time. In other words, IEP marked the value of its public company equity holdings 204% above the prevailing public market price.
* The mark is even more irregular given that IEP bought over a million shares of the company in December before immediately writing up the value of those shares by \~194% in the same month.
* In another instance, IEP marked its “Automotive Parts” division at $381 million in December 2022. Its key subsidiary declared bankruptcy a month later.
* IEP reported $455 million in “real estate holdings” in its most recent quarter. The reported values in this segment have been remarkably stable for years despite declining net income and despite including (i) the Trump Plaza in Atlantic City, which was razed to the ground in 2021; (ii) a country club that became nearly insolvent in 2020 before ownership reverted to its members in 2021; and (iii) a lack of transparency on other assets and valuations.
* The irregular valuation marks fit a pattern: In January of 2020, UBS dropped coverage of IEP citing a “lack of transparency” following its research showing marks that were “divergent from their public market values”, among other issues.
* Beyond aggressive marks, Icahn’s liquid portfolio has continued to generate losses. Our analysis of Icahn’s latest December 2022 13-F filing indicates that IEP’s long holdings have lost \~$471 million in value year to date, despite the S&amp;P gaining \~9.2% in the same time frame.
* IEP disclosed that its investment fund had a 47% notional short bet in its December 2022 filings. Given the positive market performance, we estimate this short bet has contributed at least a further $272 million in year-to-date losses.
* Overall, we estimate IEP’s current NAV as being closer to $4.4 billion, or 22% lower than its disclosed year-end indicative NAV of $5.6 billion. The analysis suggests that units currently trade at a 310% premium to NAV, with an annual dividend rate of 64% of NAV.
* Tightening matters further, IEP is highly levered, with $5.3 billion in Holdco debt and maturities of $1.1 billion, $1.36 billion, and $1.35 billion due in 2024, 2025, and 2026, respectively.
* IEP’s debt covenants limit the company’s financial flexibility: IEP is not permitted to incur additional indebtedness and is only allowed to refinance old debt. With interest rates having increased, IEP will need to pay significantly higher interest expenses on future refinancings.
* Carl Icahn’s ownership in IEP comprises about 85% of his overall net worth, according to Forbes, giving him limited room to maneuver with his own outside capital. We have assessed that Icahn has little ability or reason to bail out IEP with a capital injection, particularly at such elevated unit prices.
* Further underscoring Icahn’s limited financial flexibility, he has pledged 181.4 million units, \~60% of his IEP holdings, for personal margin loans. Margin loans are a risky form of debt often reliant on high share (or unit) prices.
* Icahn has not disclosed basic metrics around his margin loans like loan to value (LTV), maintenance thresholds, principal amount, or interest rates. We think unitholders deserve this information in order to understand the risk of margin calls should IEP unit prices revert toward NAV, a reality we see as inevitable.
* Given limited financial flexibility and worsening liquidity, we expect Icahn Enterprises will eventually cut or eliminate its dividend entirely, barring a miracle turnaround in investment performance.
* Overall, we think Icahn, a legend of Wall Street, has made a classic mistake of taking on too much leverage in the face of sustained losses: a combination that rarely ends well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/135jhep/hindenburg_icahn_enterprises_the_corporate_raider/,436,122,0,self.investing,thekeyofGflat

That American voters won’t go for him again. 

Biden won the 2020 election by Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin - without those states he would’ve been at 269 electoral votes. 

Biden won Arizona by 10,457 votes, Georgia by 11,779, and Wisconsin by 20,682. Out of 158 million votes cast, 42,918 votes. That’s fewer people than an the average attendance of a Taylor Swift concert that made the difference in the fate of our republic in 2020. 

There are key differences between 2024 and 2020, and they’re a mixed bag. 

1) Biden has incumbency advantage. 

2) It’s back to normal campaign mode. COVID restrictions are over so Biden won’t have the luxury of campaigning remotely for a good part of the campaign. 

3) Trump did not lead in any of the 2020 polls, and ended up over performing the polls quite substantially still. Going into 2024, Trump regularly is statistically tied, within striking distance, or even leading Biden in polls. 

As the Republican primary no longer looks like it’s going to be competitive, my concern is Trump waltzes to the nomination, is a full-time campaigner who leverages earned media like he did in 2016, and we’re one recession or crisis away from getting him back in power. His negatives are largely priced in at this point. 

Biden was able to beat Trump because the left wasn’t as complacent in 2020 as they were in 2016. But 2024 is feeling like deja vu. Is anyone else concerned about this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AskALiberal/comments/135fvis/is_anyone_concerned_that_theres_far_too_much/,110,121,0,self.AskALiberal,engadine_maccas1997

After the forthcoming [election](https://www.worldmagzine.com/politics/in-a-candidate-selection-for-a-new-post-suella-braverman-defeats-tory-mp/), the Move Forward Party (MFP) won’t participate in an “inter-bloc” coalition government, according to the party’s campaign assistant Piyabutr Saengkanokkul.

Piyabutr was alluding to a coalition made up of both pro-dictatorship and pro-democracy groups. The MFP would prefer to be an opposition party if a [government](https://www.worldmagzine.com/politics/liberal-governments-online-news-bill-will-lead-to-loses-everybody/) were to be formed with such a mix.

## Election Law Fairs

The Thai Sang Thai Party (TST) has denounced the populist platforms that other parties are pursuing in the run-up to the election, claiming that they allow a vicious cycle fueled by unrelenting greed that feeds corruption.

According to Khunying Sudarat Keyuraphan, [political](https://www.worldmagzine.com/politics/) parties are vying with one another to develop the strongest populist programs, promising gifts and benefits at the expense of taxpayers.

* The PPRP has suggested that a body of people be chosen to rewrite the constitution.

Khunying Sudarat also stated that the country’s ongoing political confrontation, which pits the so-called pro-democracy side against pro-dictatorship parties, is expected to worsen after the upcoming election.

To make election laws fair for everyone, the Palang Pracharath Party (PPRP) has suggested that a body of people be chosen to rewrite the constitution. The head of the party’s political strategy committee believes that the National [Village and Urban](https://www.worldmagzine.com/stock-market/saudi-bourse-rises-on-the-non-oil-activity/) Community fund needs to be promoted more as a means of boosting the grassroots economy.

To fulfill its promise to contribute 200,000 baht to each of the 79,610 national village and urban community funds across the country, the PPRP will need to allocate almost 16 billion baht.

According to opinion polls, the Prachachart Party anticipates gaining at least ten MP seats in the upcoming election. Prachachart will probably be a part of the following administration and be given at least two cabinet positions if the party can win more House seats and the opposition coalition now led by the Pheu Thai Party takes office.

Starting with a constitutional amendment to establish a fully democratic nation, the new [administration](https://www.worldmagzine.com/politics/before-a-presidency-in-2024-governor-desantis-makes-a-travels/) will put an end to issues that have gone unresolved.

I am not a Republican/conservative at all. I voted for Biden in 2020 and I'm prepared to do so again in 2024, though I will agree that we might be better off with someone who's younger (not so young that they hardly have any experience, but someone who isn't likely to have age-related health challenges). My reasons for disliking Trump actually have less to do with his political views and more because I just don't think he's a good person (if he were a Democrat but was exactly the same personality-wise, and still did a lot of the shit that he's done, I wouldn't vote for him).

Now having said this, I've read that Biden broke the record for most votes cast for a US presidential candidate, and his speech at being declared the winner was quite powerful IMO and didn't give off ""sleepy Joe"" vibes like he often does. He seemed very alert and with it. HOWEVER, since that time, I have yet to hear anyting positive about Biden. Normally, when we have a president, their supporters sing their praises while their opponents can't wait to get them out of office. But that's not the vibe I get from Biden. I have yet to hear anything positive about him, even from liberals.

So that's why part of me feels like maybe the results of the election were tampered with somehow, to give Biden more votes despite not being very popular amongst a lot of people. But it most likely was simply a case of ""anybody but Trump"", so that's probably why he got so many votes. People saw him as the less of two evils.

And I don't dislike Biden. But I do understand why he doesn't seem to have people raving about him like past presidents. I know there were a lot of people who voted for Obama who were disappointed in various things he did (or didn't do). Nonetheless, he remained quite popular amongst his supporters. But I don't see that with Biden. I've heard very few people talk about how they like how he's running the country; the only thing positive they seem to say is ""Well, at least he isn't Donald Trump!"" but that's the extent of it really. The right-wingers hate him for obvious reasons, but I've hardly heard anything positive about him during his presidency (at least so far; he still has a year left and anything could change that would make more people like him as opposed to being ""meh"" about him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/135e28t/even_though_im_not_a_trump_supporter_and_never/,194,1214,0,self.TrueUnpopularOpinion,Cut-Unique

I'm only 23, in 2018 I was 18 and voted Republican, my family is all hardcore Republican, but I always thought of myself as a moderate, never really understood the discontent with lgbt+ people and the like, have become less religious over time, etc.

I became left-leaning probably around 2019-2020, I was curious what ""The Left"" really thought and listened to Bernie Sanders talk to Joe Rogan and realized it made sense, like a lot of sense actually. Continued down, listened to Richard Wolff and Vaush (I know I know don't throw tomatoes at me lol) and overtime became aware of what was going on, with leftist thought broadly but imminently and specifically with the Republican Party and the fascist takeover of the USA.

It got extremely scary around 2020, because all the lefties I listened to online, and from studying some history particularly with Germany in the 30's I realized that the Republicans were going to lie about the election if Trump lost. Of course, he did lose, and they did lie about it. And Republican voters apparently heard clearly the implied message, and tried to use force to overthrow this country's transfer of power.

It's honestly remarkable how textbook of a descent into Fascism this has been, all the way down to the Daily Wire boys now calling for an ""eradication"" of transgenderism, and my 15 year old nephew saying ""I want to arrest any doctors who do gender surgery on minors"" - and when I point out that this is very uncommon and against existing medical standards, he remained indignant (softened slightly when we really got into arguing about it and he had a few days to calm down and think the whole ""eradication"" thing over).

There's endless details I could provide of how my standard Republican friends and family have been transformed into full-fledged supporting the Republicans in any takeover attempts they do. It's gotten so bad that when I pointed out to my mother that Viktor Orban ended democracy in Hungary, and the Republicans celebrated him at CPAC 2022 as the opening speaker, she said ""I can't believe 'they' got our kids too..."" I guess the 'they' was some ""democrat trans liberal cabal"" or some such, I don't know.

Obviously, on this subreddit, I don't need to explain how terrifying, monstrous, and disastrous a one Party United States of America ruled by the Republican Party for everyone in it, particularly the minorities, and for the world. In addition to the genocide of LGBT folk, I worry too that with them being border isolationists, and them refusing to transition us for climate change, if they hold power for 20+ years in the near future, there will end up being millions upon millions from the third world forced to flee their homes, and that right-wing militias and law enforcement will just let them die or gun them down at the borders, who knows honestly these people are fully unhinged. I've even heard my dad say of Black men protesting in the NFL by kneeling for the flag that ""They should be taken out back and shot."" And I'd say he's a standard good ol' boy Republican tbh, he's certainly not the most racist and openly genocidal one, not by a longshot.

All this to say, in 2022 with swing state Republicans running claiming they will, ""not certify the crooked elections, wouldn't have in 2020, and won't in 2024."" At the same time as Moore v Harper made it a possibility that the Supreme Court would rule in favor of ""Independent State Legislature"" doctrine, I really was bracing myself for them being able to just rig the rules or overturn the election, and that being that. Seems like everyday Desantis finds a new way to remind us that his goal is to make a little 3rd Reich down there in Florida.

But then, they largely lost in Swing States, and the Republicans backed down on the Moore v Harper Supreme Court case to my knowledge (I imagine b/c they lost so badly in the midterms, that now ruling on it wouldn't give them the power they were thinking it would.) And they keep losing special elections all over the country.

I'm not by any means convinced we are safe, and think there is still a good chance (at least 50/50) this country goes the Weimar route.

Two things that suggest to me we might make it out of this are:

1. Young voters will be the death of the GOP if they are unable to deconstruct our democracy in time, and I suspect the GOP knows this.
2. Trump is deeply unpopular still, and looks unlikely as a W for 2024, and by 2028 demographics may have shifted enough to make the Dems safe in winning.
3. With the overturning of Roe and the female backlash, I suspect the Republicans might be overplaying their hand, speaking too soon of the inhumane and freedom-restricting things they want to do.

Many many things feel despairing to me, and without the Dems reversing course and realizing how aggressive we need to be against the Republicans, and without offering real vision for positive change, I do worry that we may be doomed already, and just not know the outcome for certain yet because we don't have the vantage point of time.

Good luck and stay safe",https://www.reddit.com/r/AntifascistsofReddit/comments/1353vja/do_you_think_this_country_is_dead_already_that_it/,43,19,0,self.AntifascistsofReddit,smartcow360

(I'm a bot)
*****
&gt; It was March and former president Donald Trump was aboard his plane with a gaggle of reporters following a campaign rally in Waco, Texas.

&gt; Then a line of questioning from NBC News reporter Vaughn Hillyard, who suggested that Trump had in recent days seemed &amp;quot;Frustrated&amp;quot; by Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg&amp;#039;s investigation, began irritating the former president.

&gt; Some of Trump&amp;#039;s comments on the plane have been previously reported, such as when he responded to reporters&amp;#039; questions about Bragg&amp;#039;s probe by attacking it as a &amp;quot;Fake case&amp;quot; that &amp;quot;They&amp;#039;ve already dropped.&amp;quot; The Guardian noted how Trump lashed out at Hillyard when the NBC News reporter asked whether he was frustrated by the investigation.

&gt; Trump denied the notion, insisting, &amp;quot;We did nothing wrong,&amp;quot; and saying, &amp;quot;This is fake news, and NBC is one of the worst. Don&amp;#039;t ask me any more questions.&amp;quot; Hillyard himself said Trump avoided specifics and called the press &amp;quot;Fake news.&amp;quot; But the full scope of Trump&amp;#039;s tirade, including his throwing the reporter&amp;#039;s phones, has not been previously reported.

&gt; The only reporters on Trump&amp;#039;s plane for last week&amp;#039;s trip to New Hampshire were from friendly conservative outlets: Henry Rodgers of The Daily Caller and Daniel Baldwin of OANN. Baldwin, in his write-up of the trip, wrote of the &amp;quot;Warm&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Welcoming&amp;quot; former president, &amp;quot;It&amp;#039;s clear Trump values the opinions of everyone he surrounds himself with, whether he agrees or disagrees. He even turned to me and said, &amp;#039;You really know your sports.&amp;#039;&amp;quot; In a surprising turn, Trump is slated to participate in a town hall on CNN next week.

&gt; Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung did not respond to a question about Trump tossing the phone, but did speak to the campaign&amp;#039;s press availability.

Unique polling questions can get attention-grabbing results, because people actuallly stop to think about them, they are influenced towards them by yesterday's news stories, by the phrasing of the question, their private desires, etc. But election polling shows where will partisan loyalties ultimately fall, and those seem to be exactly where they have been since 2016; with everything depending on how a few thousand voters in swing states are feeling that day, and how the economy is doing that month.

A lot of this feels like 2016 delusions about how Trump ""*ought to lose* by 30 points dammit, I mean just look at him!""

Back then, that was written off as a liberal/leftist media bubble, but a lot of it was not as simple as a naive assumption of ""I don't know anyone who supports him in my own friend group so he must have no chance"", but also somewhat similar to what Vaush has been doing recently: Even when trying to understand how ""normies"" or the ""median voter"" think, it is easy to overestimate how many people really are out there who even *get to hear* non-partisan news on the regular at all, yet hasn't committed to either side yet.",https://www.reddit.com/r/VaushV/comments/134w4al/are_we_getting_really_overconfident_on_the/,39,23,0,self.VaushV,Genoscythe_

The 2022 Midterm Election is the most important midterm of our lifetime.Democrats must behave as if our lives depend on this midterm, because our future depends on the outcome.

”We the people” must deny the Republican party political power at every level of government for decades to come “in order to create a more perfect union.” With 48 States having some statewide contest(s), November 8th, 2022 is our best chance the Democrats will get to do that for the rest of this decade, at least.

”The List” encourages the election of a Democratic Supermajority in the US Senate in 2022. This is the best chance we will have to create a Democratic Supermajority in both Chambers of Congress for the remainder of this decade. This midterm could be a devastating loss for the democrats if good patriots ignore this election. If Americans of good conscience band together instead, we could could begin the exile of the Republican party from power, not for years, but for decades to come.

“The List” is a set of suggestions about where to focus collective activism today.

The election of Democratic Supermajorities to both chambers of the US Congress is the best outcome we can strive towards in the 2022 Midterm Election for many reasons. Among them: breaking the decade of gridlock in Congress, supporting President Biden’s agenda, and his re-election in 2024. My personal favorite is that this could commence the decades-long political banishment of the GOP from power, which the Republican Party so richly deserves.

The Republican party has proved itself treasonous on many levels. They are traitors to Humanity by supporting Trump. Traitors to the Nation for supporting Putin. Traitors to the government and betrayers of the constitution through their apologies for the 1/6/21 insurrection. To safeguard our country and the world, we must block the Republicans from power at the ballot box, at all levels of government, for at least a generation.

Political game playing may be inevitable among humans. Change the numbers, and then change the rules, if not the game. Cynical refusal to play at this time in history cedes power to NAZIs manipulated by Active Measures. That is a surrender to crypto fascism, not radical thinking, mere cynicism, or hipsterism.

In 2022, Patriots must unify to crush the Republican Party at the ballot box. We can defeat them in every State, at every level. We need the biggest turnout at the voting booth of any Midterm ever. We need to raise more money for candidates and organizations than we did during the entire 2020 campaign season if we are to accomplish this. We need to do this in the next six months.

This is what a “Blue Tsunami” REALLY looks like.

Electing a Democratic Supermajority in Congress is our hope for the future and retribution for America’s enemies. “22 Blue in 2022” is a roadmap to the beginning of that journey. “22 Blue in 2022” is our war plan. ”22 Blue in 2022” is our electoral battle cry. “22 Blue in 2022” is a way forward out of gridlock, a way to non-violently thwart those who would poison the body politic with their hate.

If we don’t try this hard in 2022, Trump will go unpunished and metastasize by 2024.

Resist In Power, my sisters, my brothers, and my others.

Resist Together, and elect a Congressional Supermajority in 2022!

Comparing to Biden does not tell us much. Example: If you compare something to a pile of poo then you only find out that the thing is better than a pile of poo.

Trump is just the odd cousin within the western oligarchy. They don't like him, but he is one of them:

Ron Paul could have dismantled the FED from the inside, giving us sound money.

He made Rostin ""tamp it"" Behnam commisioner of the CoveringForTheCrooks

He assigned Goldman-Sachs Steven Mnuchin to Sec.Treasury

Pompeo: globalist, Barr: you know what

He does not like competition to the dollar

He was very friendly with Klaus Schwab in the 2018+2020 WEF: [Opening Speech WEF 2018 @11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UT7GlaDc060), [Opening Speech WEF 2020 @9:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U71xW9icM9o)

He was also a pusher for Operation Warp Speed (""safe and effective"")

He could have appointed Judge Napolitano to the Supreme Court but chose differently 3 times!

He could have declassified 9-11 documents (ask ae911truth.org what they want or give me video of dozens of pentagon security cameras or metallurgic analysis of ground zero)

Nominated the corrupt Sec.Commerce Wilbur Ross

He chose the WMD war-monger John Bolton (at least he later fired him, so yay! something)

He could have released papers that were classified by previous administrations

Is he just controlled by some group that has some dark evidence about him?

Don't tell me he has to pick who they choose: why not just expose that? Even if they threaten his kids: why would he instead condemn his descendents to eternal slavery?

He didn’t pardon Snowden, Assange, Manning, Binney...

Under him more than 50 thousand [bombs/rockets dropped](https://www.commondreams.org/views/2022/01/10/hey-hey-usa-how-many-bombs-did-you-drop-today)

The task is not to shore up a  semi-imaginary and defunct Western-led “rules-based order”, but to  avoid catastrophic conflict in a post-hegemonic world.  
&gt;  
&gt;The US will remain a great power. Even so, American decline is a  trajectory human agency cannot alter. The idea that a nation now so  intractably divided could construct a new international order is  far-fetched.  
&gt;  
&gt;Intensifying political polarisation poses a question about the  capacity of American government to execute any long-term strategy. Even  if it is defensible in legal terms, Trump’s indictment confirms that the  justice system has become a weapon in partisan political warfare. As  the next presidential election approaches in 2024, the US is entering a  legitimation crisis.  
&gt;  
&gt;This implosion forms the background of an accelerating international retreat. [Saudi Arabia](https://www.newstatesman.com/tag/saudi-arabia)’s joining the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, the Chinese-brokered Saudi-Iranian rapprochement, [Brazil](https://www.newstatesman.com/tag/brazil), South [Africa](https://www.newstatesman.com/world/africa) and Malaysia opting for closer ties with [China](https://www.newstatesman.com/tag/china), and [India](https://www.newstatesman.com/tag/india) being increasingly non-aligned testify to America’s rapid descent. [China](https://www.newstatesman.com/tag/china)’s proposals for peace in [Ukraine](https://www.newstatesman.com/tag/ukraine-country) may be vague and not altogether serious, but [Russia](https://www.newstatesman.com/tag/russia) cannot be restrained without Chinese intervention. A multipolar international system is already in operation.  
&gt;  
&gt;American strategists are fixated on a world that belongs in the past. China has major vulnerabilities, including an [economy](https://www.newstatesman.com/tag/economy) weakened  by Xi’s ruinous Zero Covid policy and an army that has not had combat  experience since the Sino-Vietnamese border war of 1979. The US, despite  the drawdown of some of its armaments for use in Ukraine, retains  formidable military capabilities battle-honed in decades of almost  continuous foreign conflicts.  
&gt;  
&gt;Yet America is unprepared for the war so many in Washington think is  coming. It has offshored much of its industrial base to China. It  continues to be heavily reliant on [China](https://www.newstatesman.com/tag/china) for medical supplies and on [Taiwan](https://www.newstatesman.com/tag/taiwan) for high-end computer chips. Even if a national industrial strategy of the kind [Joe Biden](https://www.newstatesman.com/tag/joe-biden) has launched is consistently implemented, remedying this self-inflicted dependency will take many years.  
&gt;  
&gt;The world situation is similar to that in the run-up to 1914. New technologies have not overcome rivalry over scarce natural resources,  only shifted its focus. A new version of the late-19th-century Great  Game is being waged for strategic metals in [Africa](https://www.newstatesman.com/world/africa) and  the resources of Siberia and central Asia. Beginning as a response  to russian aggression, the conflict in Ukraine has morphed into a proxy  war between great powers in which resources are as important as ideology.  
&gt;  
&gt;The least illuminating way of understanding this conflict is a collision between [democracy](https://www.newstatesman.com/tag/democracy) and  autocracy. There will be democratic states and tyrannies, along with  myriads of hybrid regimes, in any foreseeable future. The hubristic  fantasy of a global liberal order must be replaced by realism, restraint  and an unceasing struggle to stave off disaster.

Warren and Marshall's bill, which seeks to regulate crypto wallet providers like traditional financial institutions, is a thinly-veiled attempt to dismantle the crypto market under the guise of national security. By requiring wallet providers to register as money services businesses, the bill would impose insurmountable regulatory burdens on crypto entrepreneurs, effectively stifling innovation and progress in the sector.

Moreover, the proposed legislation seeks to ban crypto privacy tools, a move that would have far-reaching consequences for individuals worldwide. Privacy is a fundamental aspect of cryptocurrency, and without it, users' transaction histories would be exposed to the public, making them vulnerable to theft and surveillance. The ban on privacy tools would not only affect everyday users but also citizens of totalitarian regimes and oppressed communities who rely on crypto to sustain their livelihoods discreetly.

The irony of this bill is that it contradicts the values both Warren and Marshall have claimed to champion in their political careers. By supporting the legislation, Marshall betrays the populist and pro-Trump principles he campaigned on, while Warren undermines the civil liberties and privacy ideals of progressivism.

The consequences of this bill extend beyond the crypto industry. If enacted, the legislation would set a dangerous precedent for government surveillance, potentially leading to a future where personal financial data is readily accessible by authorities without a warrant. This would be a grave violation of citizens' privacy and civil liberties.

As the debate on this bill continues, it's crucial for Congress to consider the far-reaching implications of such legislation. If civil libertarians in the Supreme Court, like Justice Neil Gorsuch, have to step in as the last line of defence for the crypto industry, then it's clear that the democratic process has failed to protect citizens' rights.

In conclusion, the Warren-Marshall crypto bill is an alarming Trojan horse that threatens the core principles of privacy, decentralization, and innovation in the cryptocurrency space. We must stand vigilant against this legislative overreach and ensure that the future of crypto remains open, accessible, and free from unwarranted government intrusion.

Our plan was to travel from St. Louis to an area in Arkansas called Hot Springs. A cabin Air bnb in the woods awaited us where we planned on taking some shrooms.

I grabbed my backpack and left my front door and crammed myself into Smokey's car. I sat in the back with my friend Elbert and his girlfriend Gina, Smokey's girlfriend Autumn sat in the front passenger seat with her beagle named Meatball.

I didn't know anyone very well besides Smokey, so I thought that being stuck in a car with a bunch of strangers for 9 hours would be a good way of putting myself out there, as I am very introverted. We had a nice road trip there without anything out of the ordinary happening on the way, it was just your usual road trip.

We arrived at the Air bnb at night, stretching my legs as I stepped out of the car, we all entered the cabin and proceeded to explore the rooms. Elbert called the upstairs room and Smokey called dibs on the master bedroom. I didn't have a date with me so I opted to sleep on the couch. Before bed I rolled up a joint and smoked it in the backyard of the place. While I was smoking I noticed a Trump 2024 Banner on this big shed/garage in the backyard that the landlord used. I thought nothing of this at the time and went back inside and fell asleep eager to trip the next morning.

During breakfast the next morning while we ate and talked about how we were excited to trip, we heard a knock on the front door. Through the glass door we saw an older man in his 50's wearing a big southern grin. 

He introduced himself as the landlord's handyman. Smokey, Autumn and I stepped outside to chat with him. We shot the shit for a few minutes until out of nowhere he starts telling us how easy it would be to kill Autumn and hide her body, then he pulls out a knife and sharpens some pencils. He hands us the pencils and says, ""These make for great self defense weapons, you can even take them on a plane"".

Now you would think that this is the person who ends up stabbing me, but no, he was actually just fucking with us. He actually turned out to be pretty cool. 

The 3 of us went back inside and told Elbert and Gina about our interaction with the handyman, and joked about how he said he was gonna kill Autumn. They didn't seem to care much and just continued to eat their breakfast.

After breakfast we were ready to take our shrooms. I had ground up about 3.5 of some penis envy mushrooms and began to make my lemon tek. Elbert and Gina made a tea and Smokey just ate them straight.

The vibes in the room seemed chill when we first started taking them, I remember drinking my lemon tek and it hit me almost instantly. 

30 minutes later we were all sitting outside in the backyard chilling on the come up, but Gina was just acting a bit higher than the rest of us, I didn't want to be judgmental though so I just let her do her thing and dance with the trees, but then out of nowhere she dumps meatball in my lap and he was covered in dogshit, I got it all over me, but again we were all on shrooms and I didn't want to ruin the vibe so I just laughed it off and went inside to clean myself off.

The shrooms were really starting to hit at this point, I suggested we go on a walk and explore the woods but quickly change my mind, because its hard to control a group of people who are all on shrooms and not get split up. However, Smokey still wanted to go on a walk, and this created a divide within the group of those who wanted to walk and who didn't. It was just so hard to communicate effectively while on shrooms.

Elbert and Gina didn't want to go on a walk and even though I agreed with them, since we were all high, I just couldn't get that across. Gina then started talking about how she doesn't feel safe to go on a walk and she hysterically brings up the Trump 2024 banner, and starts talking about the stupid joke about killing Autumn that the handyman made. She said he was a racist and that this place was in a sundown town, and she was connecting it to how her great great grandparents were slaves in this part of Arkansas, and since her and Elbert were black she felt like she was in danger.

She was clearly becoming delusional, and it was becoming clear that she really couldn't handle the amount of shrooms she took. (I think she took 1-2 grams but I'm not sure)

I tried to tell her how its safe and no one is going to hurt us, but like I said its just not easy to communicate effectively while on shrooms. It was no use. Not to mention Elbert kept defending her because he didn't want to lose her as a girlfriend.

Tensions were clearly rising but I figured if I ignored the problem it will go away, trying to communicate seemed to just escalate the situation. 

Smokey and Autumn stepped outside again and hung out in the backyard and as I sat downstairs by myself pondering the situation and life itself. I began to hear a banging upstairs. I thought it was Smokey and Elbert fighting and I was just gonna let it play out, but then I realized that since we are in a cabin in the middle of the woods and we are all on shrooms, they could easily kill each other if nobody stops them.

As I started to walk up the steps, I stopped halfway and listened. I could hear faint, tense, heavy breaths being exerted and muffled stomping. It sounded like two people wrestling. I pushed aside any fear I had and began walking up the rest of the stairs. I knew I had to stop whatever was going on. 

This is where things slow down, just a couple steps before I enter the room. The tense heavy breaths start to become words and I make out, ""You want me to kill myself? huh? Do you?"" and I hear another voice saying ""No! No! I don't want you to kill yourself!"" 

Now after hearing this I assumed that they were going to try and jump out of the window, so I was actually very relaxed when I finally entered the room, I was expecting to just say, ""come on guys knock it off, you are just high"" after all they might break their leg if they jump out of the window but they wouldn't die. It wasn't a far fall, and the window was covered up with an AC unit so it wasn't even really possible to do.

However, when I made it into the room and saw what was really happening, I didn't even know what to think. Gina was pulling a knife towards her throat and the only only thing stopping it from entering her throat was Elbert pulling it away from her in the opposite direction. Immediately after I realized what was going on Gina threw the knife towards the corner of the room.

I literally didn't have any fucking time to think. I've never made a decision so fast in my entire life, its like something in me took over and I just dove forward towards them and tried to grab the knife, we all dove for it at the same time, but Gina was the quickest. I found myself behind her trying to get ahold of her wrists but it was no use. She stabs Elbert in the face and then I feel 3 quick taps along the right side of my body, there was no pain at all, but somehow I could still tell I was being stabbed. I just had to get out of there. I knew if I left she was going to kill Elbert and then herself but I had no choice I had to get the fuck out of there. She was still stabbing at me as I was fleeing and as I escaped down the stairs I remember thinking, ""Okay you just left them to die, but that's okay, just get out of here and get help"" 

I was in a huge state of shock, its like nothing that happened was phasing me. I ran out the front door and down the long gravel driveway, as I ran I started to feel wet all under my clothes and that's when I knew I had really gotten stabbed. I took my hoodie off and there was blood all over me. I could literally feel my blood pressure dropping from all the blood I was losing, and that's when I really thought I was going to die.

I approach a guy working by his truck and all I could tell him was, ""ahh, she got me good""

I didn't really know what to say, I was in such a state of shock that I didn't know what to do. I figured all he needed was to see me covered in blood and he would know what to do but he pretty much just stood there and did nothing. I realized I could die just tried to accept it, but then out of nowhere Autumn runs up to me and ties my shirt over the wound on my arm. 

She asks me what happened and I tell her Gina stabbed me. She wanted to go back into the cabin to help Smokey, but I told her that I really need her to be by my side so I don't die alone. She kept reassuring me that I wasn't going to die, but I was certain I had gotten stabbed 3 times, I looked at my ribcage and could see blood leaking out of a little slit in my side. I showed Autumn but she kept telling me there wasn't a wound there. It must have been the shrooms causing me to see this.

I remember giving her a shit eating grin and saying, ""So this is how it happens huh?"" I really thought I was gonna die. I think the mushrooms were sort of giving me an ego death mentality too and that strengthened the thought that I was gonna die even more. Its weird when you genuinely think you aren't gonna be around the next day. I remember thinking that it sucked that I was gonna die in front of this girl and most likely traumatize her for the rest of her life.

The worker by his truck then chimes in, ""Did you guys want me to call the cops? or..."".

We were like yeah no shit call an ambulance. I remember getting so thirsty from the blood loss and just wanting some water, I was fine with dying at this point. I just didn't want to die thirsty. I can't tell how long it took for the cops to arrive, due to time dilation from the shrooms, but after they arrived, a female cop came to my aid and put her hands on my shoulders to calm me down. She began asking me questions like, ""How long was the knife?"" and ""Why did they stab you?"" and I was trying just to remain silent and not incriminate myself while tripping balls and bleeding. It was a lot to manage mentally.

Then I see Elbert step out of the house with blood dripping down his face, and I think to myself, ""Holy shit he's alive"", I really thought he was gonna die and was so thankful he was ok then I realized he is gonna hate me for leaving him there to die.

After the ambulance arrived, they patched me up and informed me I had only been stabbed once and wasn't going to die. I talked with a detective and they asked me if I wanted to press charges on Gina, I was surprised to hear she wasn't dead either. I told them I wasn't gonna press charges. They took me to the hospital, sewed me up, and I rode back to St. louis with fresh stitches in my arm. Gina stayed in Arkansas jail for I don't know how long. I haven't checked in on her at all. I just wanna forgive and forget it all.

I know its abrupt but I'm getting tired of typing so I'm gonna end the story here. Hopefully this was interesting to read, I consider my life to be relatively boring so I never assume people would wanna hear any of my stories, like is me getting stabbed really that interesting? I don't know I guess we'll see.

I have endless thoughts about this event, and could write forever about it, so I have to end it here. If anyone has any questions just ask and I can fill in more details.

In short, It was quite a fucking mental mind fuck to go through all of that while on 3.5 grams of shrooms.",https://www.reddit.com/r/shrooms/comments/134cik2/the_time_i_got_stabbed_while_on_shrooms_trip/,16,14,0,self.shrooms,Baked_The_Cake

This is the last part of a three-part series about how, in recent years, the Republican party has diverged from ideological conservatism. In Part 1, I talked about the rise and fall of fiscal conservatism within the GOP, and in Part 2, I went over the party's increasingly radical stance towards American institutions. In Part 3, I want to talk about a political factor that dwarfs the rest in politics -- vibes. Brands, emotions, confidence. Visions for the future.

At this time, we must recognize our biases and understand that the vast majority of Americans do not follow electoral analysis the way we do. They can't point out which of Texas' 886 identical square counties is Tarrant. If you say the words Blansas or Ablaska in front of most people they will assume you are unwell. Many Americans' understanding of politics is shaped through traditional methods; by evaluating the state of the economy, by reading the news, by watching political ads.

I am, of course, not suggesting that most voters are wishy-washy irrational feeling-havers. But there is a reason why parties speak in stirring advertisements instead of thirty-minute presentations. The average voter is not going to read every plank in the platforms of everyone they vote for. Thus, parties must establish brands to tell voters who they are -- who and what they stand for, and who and what they stand against. What they see when they think of America's past, present, and future. Visions are poetry -- they lose something when translated into prose.

Political parties are often most successful when they can wield emotion and personal experience to their benefit. The powerlessness of staring down a $7 box of cereal at the grocery store lingers longer in the mind than any inflation statistic repeated urgently on the news. The contented satisfaction that comes from saving enough money to put a down payment on a house; the claustrophobia of credit card debt; the joy of seeing your child grow up with less to worry about than you did; the dread of a parent who sees a school not too different from one they dropped their kid off at that morning on the news surrounded by cop cars and blaring sirens. Everyone feels. Brands that speak to American's fears, hopes, and dreams are at the center of good campaigning.

So what has become of the Republicans' brand over time?

# Long Morning Shadows

Before anything else, watch the ['Morning in America' ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUMqic2IcWA), even if you have before. The shadow of Reagan has hung over American politics, and American conservatism in particular, since his big win in 1980. His political skill allowed him to succeed in something Democrats have struggled with forever: branding. In calm, clear language, Reagan made the case for 'small government,' and 'peace through strength,' and 'law and order.' He built the Republican brand into one of optimism, of hope, of a steady hand guiding America through tough times.

The above ad from 1984 encapsulates this sensibility. It makes you feel good about America. It feels apolitical. It feels nice. And most importantly, it is irrefutable. What kind of person could disagree with the substance of this ad? It allows Republicans to deal solely in the positive, the feel-good, and the hopeful, while insinuating that their opponents would object to the happy times depicted. When I talk about a modern 'optimistic' conservative brand, this is what I mean. A positive, hopeful message that Americans of all political persuasions like to hear, with a wicked-sharp underside that purposefully conflates criticism of conservative policies with anti-Americanism.

Following the electoral success of the Tea Party in 2010, Republicans thought they had a good shot at the White House, as the economic recovery was slower than expected and Obama's approval rating was stuck in the mid-forties. The President was forced into an aggressive, quip-and-gaffe-heavy campaign that exhausted many voters, while Romney portrayed himself as the one who could untangle Washington gridlock. Most polls showed the race between the two as being a close one, which meant the strong Democratic performance came as a shock. The Obama-Biden ticket won the popular vote by four points, and the tipping-point state was Colorado, which had favored the Ds by over five points. It was a surprisingly weak performance for a ticket that seemed to fuse the insurgent energy of the Tea Party with a safe, experienced presidential nominee.

In the aftermath of that fiasco, the RNC commissioned the Growth and Opportunity Project report, more commonly known as the 'autopsy,' which examined the loss and made recommendations for the GOP's messaging going forward. The report was blunt, declaring that

&gt;Public perception of the Party is at record lows. Young voters are increasingly rolling their eyes at what the Party represents, and many minorities wrongly think that Republicans do not like them or want them in the country. When someone rolls their eyes at us, they are not likely to open their ears to us.

It argued that Republicans needed to refocus their efforts on ethnic minorities as well as young voters if they wanted to make up the party's weakness in presidential contests that stretched back to the nineties, and that the party should demonstrate how its economy policies could work for lower- and middle-income Americans. But perhaps most incisively, it declared

&gt;The Republican Party needs to stop talking to itself. We have become experts in how to provide ideological reinforcement to like-minded people, but devastatingly we have lost the ability to be persuasive with, or welcoming to, those who do not agree with us on every issue.

It was a sober acknowledgement of pervasive echo-chamber politics within the GOP, and made a forceful statement against getting complacent, writing off any block of voters, and ideological purity tests. The party would face the prospect of losing with dignity and optimism, and learn lessons from losing until they had rebuilt the party's brand at the national level as a more inclusive one.

# Sunset

The plan lasted less than four years. Once Trump took a dominant lead in the 2016 Republican primary, it became clear that the autopsy's vision would be itself inhumed. Trump went all-out on inflammatory ethnically-tinged politics like promising to build a wall, deport millions of illegal immigrants, and ban Muslims from entering the country. While 2012 was thought to be a low point for Republican support among minorities, given that the election was between the first black president and a Mormon billionaire, 2016 was barely better. In addition, Trump only slightly improved on Romney's numbers with independents or young voters. But he did find some success with lower-income voters. And, of course, he found a way to win the race while rejecting nearly all of the autopsy's recommendations. His win would recast the party's brand in his own image as he converted the Republican old guard and introduced new faces to politics.

Trump's win reoriented the party in almost the entirely opposite direction that the autopsy suggested; the party should speak *more*, and listen less. Rather than moderating the platform or messaging to appeal to groups disinclined to vote for Republicans, the Trump administration would charge boldly ahead with its original agenda, seeking confrontation with Democrats and an overturn of as much of Obama's policies as possible, while compromising little. The conciliatory brand was canned and replaced with one with existential confrontation at its center. The party was not simply a party anymore; it was a *movement* \-- one that was locked in constant conflict with the Dirty Dems, the Deep State, the Globalists, and other various anti-American forces. America is beset by a tidal wave of shadowy rogues that envision the downfall of the U.S, and the Swamp prevents anyone from averting America's ruin. Only One Man Can Fix It. Are you with him?

The politics of 2020 were deeply bitter. For most people, they had never known a time in their life where political discussions were so unavoidable, so unenjoyable, so *unproductive* as they were during that time. It felt like the quality of political discourse had reached an all-time low; cynicism hung over the country like thick smog. Few people were inclined to assume their opponents were arguing in good faith. But after the election, the Democratic party changed. The GOP didn't.

The 'stop the steal' effort, and the success in Trump and co. in convincing so much of the party that the election was stolen, only ensured that this exhausting, overwhelmingly negative flavor of politics would be amplified within the Republican Party. Democrats were not simply dishonest, or naive, or corrupt; they were fundamentally illegitimate. If you truly believe the Democratic Party stole the election -- from not just anyone, but the one honest politician in Washington fighting against America's downfall -- policy proposals are unimportant. 'Moving on' is what traitors and RINOs do. Optimism is defeatism. The autopsy warned of echo-chamber politics, and the dangers of only talking to those already agree with you. But, in the new view, are people who disagree with you on such fundamental levels worth engaging in conversation?

Ten years ago, the Republican party was arguably on a path to a more optimistic and proactive brand of conservatism, perhaps led by figures like Nikki Haley and Tim Scott. Since then, optimism has been purged from the brand. Defeating the enemy is now more central to Republican party messaging than improving the lives of Americans. The anti-Trump elements are so weak that they were unable to prevent Trump from hand-picking a slate of MAGA candidates that learned no lessons from 2020 and delivered a thoroughly depressing 2022 wipeout. Moderates and Republican donors continue to be shocked that the Manichean they put in charge of the party refuses to simply disappear on his own. And now, the party sleepwalks into 2024, having made little effort to provide any new hope, any reason for Americans to be optimistic about a Republican administration other than the prospect of seeing their political enemies made more miserable then they are.

It gets worse.

# Twilight of the Optimists

As of writing this, the Republican primary polling looks like this, according to the RCP average:

Trump 51.3% | DeSantis 23.0 | Pence 5.4 | Haley 3.9 | Ramaswamy 2.3 | Scott 2.2

all others at 1.0 or less each.

These numbers may change. DeSantis could get the (meat)ball rolling and improve his numbers once he begins to campaign in earnest. Haley or Scott could find a lane. Someone like Mike Pence or Asa Hutchinson or Chris Sununu could take a forceful stance on moving past Trump at the debates and turn the race on its head. But these seem to be, at least right now, just fantasies.

What's most likely is that Trump will maintain his huge lead, and his opponents will fail to gain enough of a foothold to dislodge him. Given everything that has happened with Trump -- the coup attempt, the 2022 fiasco, the potential indictments -- more than half of Republicans still want him to be the nominee again. Those are steep odds for any challenger.

But all of his opponents are even weaker than they would be normally. Dislodging Trump would likely either casting doubt on his conservative leadership or his general electability. But Trump has succeeded in banishing the anti-him faction to the fringes since 2016. Most mainstream Republicans worked with him during his administration and lauded his leadership then. And, of course, no one can directly attack Trump's electability problem, because a significant percentage of Republican primary voters believe he doesn't have one, and that he actually won 2020. To suggest Trump can't win an election necessitates acknowledging his election defeat, which will alienate a large percentage of his supporters and increase the likelihood of Trump launching a third-party run if he somehow loses the nomination. Under normal circumstances, every other candidate on the stage could learn from 2016 and band together to reject Trump, but the threat of a spoiler run keeps them all in check. No one but Trump is playing with a full deck, and everyone knows he has a stack of aces in his pocket just in case.

What is most likely to happen is a bruising, depressing primary in which Trump takes swing after bloody swing at some of the party's once-brightest hopes from the before-Trump era, and they will have little choice but to take it with their hands at their sides. In 2016, there was a novelty to Trump, as few people believed he would win the nomination and even fewer believed he could win the general. There was a degree of fun for all Americans in watching an reality TV star humiliate a Bush on television. No one's having fun now. Very few people will enjoy watching a series of somewhat-likeable politicians step up hopeful visions for the future, only to be trampled by Trump on his way to turning 2024 into a revenge tour.

Again, I could be wrong here. The primary could surprise us. I'd love to come back to this post in a year and laugh at my unwarranted pessimism. But I'm not holding my breath. If the opposition hasn't dropped out by then, and if a miracle doesn't happen, August 2023 is going to be the start of the most psychically exhausting and miserable primary in recent memory.

# Midnight in America

So what does Trump's 2024 vision look like, and how does it differ from conservative campaigns of the past? To compare, watch these two ads in sequence: [from Reagan's 1980 campaign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VXXwyl5G0A), and [from Trump's 2024 campaign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zwy05u6ncg).

Both involve a Republican challenge to an unpopular Democratic incumbent. Both center around the claim that America's weak leadership is emboldening its enemies. Both begin with a 'negative' segment aimed at the incumbent, followed by a 'positive' segment extolling the challenger. But you may notice a slight difference between the two, perhaps best illuminated by one line in the Reagan ad:

&gt;Whatever else history may say about my candidacy, I hope it will be recorded that I appealed to our best hopes, not our worst fears; to our confidence, rather than our doubts; to the facts, not to fantasies.

The Reagan ad is hopeful, showing plenty of the man himself and soundbites of his voice promising to lead the country through a dark hour. The Trump ad is the complete opposite -- deeply negative and cynical. And, when talking about what Trump will do, the ad focuses more on who he will teach a lesson to, rather than those Americans he plans to help. The Reagan ad's 'negative' segment lasts for twenty-five seconds, or about 21 percent of the ad. The Trump ad is, by the numbers, almost three times as negative, with the first segment comprising 62 percent of the ad. Folks, this is eighteen months from the election. Do not expect to be uplifted. This opening salvo a *year and a half* from Election Day includes live footage of a drug overdose and mother being shot at at point-blank range, along with the threat of nuclear annihilation. It only goes downhill from here.

For all that can be said about Trump's 2020 campaign, it was not this overwhelmingly negative. Of course, a big part of that was because Trump was the incumbent, but the 1980, 2004, and 2012 campaigns show that re-election efforts are not always good-vibes-only zones. Trump mixed in spots like [""Carefully""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emnCFyi5cuQ) and [""American Comeback""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ws66liLKGzA) that told Americans the hopeful message they wanted to hear after a draining year, even touting an image of Trump as a bipartisan leader. Trump knows how to run an optimistic campaign; he's just not interested in running one anymore.

This abdication of hopeful messaging, once the center of conservative politics, has left the concept open for Democrats to rush in. Watch this opening ad from the Biden campaign, [""Flag""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZO5OMrnfXM).

Smiling Americans living happy lives. Flags everywhere. An irrefutable premise of 'for freedom, for democracy, for America,' suggesting that *some people* are opposed to these concepts. Sound familiar?

As Republicans have increasingly abandoned 80s-style all-American conservative branding, Democrats have seized on it. Few pundits thought the frequent invocation of 'threats to democracy' would save Democrats in the midterm, just before they won big. If Republicans want to emphasis doom, gloom, and revolution in their ads, Democrats will happily hoist the flags, sing the anthem, and declare themselves the party fundamentally aligned with America.

# True Blue

While on the topic of the late-20th century GOP, I want to add in an increasingly noticeable reality. Consider the classic quote, often attributed to Bill Clinton:

&gt;Democrats want to fall in love; Republicans just fall in line.

In much of the late 20th century, the Republican party developed a strong electoral loyalty, founded on discipline. While it was believed that Democrats would become infatuated with eloquent candidates that promised them the moon, rank-and-file Republicans far better understood the practical realities of politics. Conservatives knew that most political goals were achieved in the long run, and that sometimes they needed to prioritize electable candidates to maintain and grow their power, especially after *Roe v. Wade* was decided in 1973. They understood that, to do *anything*, first you have to get elected. You can hold politicians accountable *after* you've taken power. And so, while Democrats struggled to unite and excite their fickle base, the Republican rank-and-file voted often, even for candidates they didn't personally like.

The poles have shifted. The 2020 Democratic primary saw a bit of political maneuvering to unite behind Biden, seen as the most electable candidate, and many progressives held their noses and voted for him, instead of voting third-party or staying home like they did in 2016. It paid off, and those progressives realized that they could push Biden to the left *after* he was elected. Going into 2024, even Bernie Sanders, the outsider-in-chief himself, has endorsed Biden. The party is becoming more disciplined, being prepared to, as the saying goes, 'vote blue no matter who.'

The GOP is going in the opposite direction. The 2022 election saw the Republican rank-and-file get behind candidates they *loved*, rather than electable candidates they could stomach. The Michigan GOP has essentially collapsed as a result of lack of electoral discipline, and the PA GOP is teetering on the edge. Kari Lake was beloved by the Republican base, and even floated as a potential VP pick before she even won her Arizona governor's race. And, surely enough, as Republicans fell in love, the Democrats fell in line behind Katie Hobbs, a bland, inoffensive pick who barely campaigned. The elements that made Kari Lake soar so high in the primary turned out to be dead weight in a general, and she managed to lose one of the most winnable races of 2022 in humiliating fashion.

And, of course, the personal loyalty to Trump and constant RINO-bashing has led to a loss of discipline in the GOP itself at all levels. The base wants Trump, despite his disapproval by independents. Any other candidate winning the primary would likely prompt deflated turnout among the base. Republicans are now the ones desperately trying to enthuse their supporters, while many Democrats are ready to hit the polls rain, sleet, or hail without a push.

This mentality prevails even at higher levels, as in the Speaker fight. Matt Gaetz famously said, regarding his opposition to McCarthy, ‘I don’t care if we got a plurality, and we elect Hakeem Jeffries.' There are parts of the party that now see opposing factions of the party as just as much of an adversary as the Democrats, which does not bode well for the future of the GOP. Kevin McCarthy himself has far exceeded my own expectations in political ability, managing to keep the party together (so far) in the House, but the cracks remain.

I want you to listen to this [certified banger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp_2embNSfQ) from Nixon's landslide 1972 campaign. How does it make you feel?

Uplifted? Optimistic? Hopeful? Patriotic? All of them?

The Republican party once understood the power of positive emotion. No matter what anyone says, there is an undeniable truth baked deep into the heart of U.S. politics: most voters want to feel good about their country. They want to feel hopeful. When they cast their vote, they want to feel like they are directly contributing to a better America. The GOP has abandoned the politics of positivity in the past few years, and replaced it with an deeply exhausting, all-encompassing negativity, while allowing the Democrats to lay claim to the same brand Republicans used to use to win over the country.

Examine the simple phrase at the heart of Trumpism -- 'Make America Great Again.' In 2016, this was a hopeful phrase that made many Americans feel like the were part of a massive effort to turn the page on the establishment that had enriched itself at the expense of the rest of us. But once Trump got elected, the meaning changed. A Republican trifecta in 2017 was not enough to Make America Great Again. Trump was now surrounded by enemies. The Swamp went deeper than we imagined. At the same time Trump insisted that we 'Keep America Great' in 2020, he also declared that the anti-American forces were stronger than ever, and the phrase failed to stick. After Trump lost, the meaning changed once more, requiring an even stronger attack on American institutions. For all that has been said or done, we are no closer to a Making America Great Again than we were before Trump was elected. All that has changed is that the GOP now demands stronger loyalty and less concern for democratic norms from its party. The promise of a Great America shimmers on the horizon like a mirage. And this is at the heart of the branding failure.

In the Trumpist view, America can never be truly great again. For if there were some objective measure of greatness, the Republican party could, at some point, declare victory, and the MAGA movement would no longer be needed, as it had achieved its goal. But Trump and his allies have no plans of letting their movement dissolve. Thus, the war is never won. When Republicans win, the war must escalate. When Republicans lose, the war must escalate. The enemy can be hurt but never killed, and thus always poses an existential threat. MAGA can never truly lose, but it can never truly win. The rejection of an optimistic conservative vision for America is not so much a conscious strategic choice as it is a fundamental and inescapable consequence of allowing the party to be captured by an unfulfillable promise.

And thus, the rejection of conservatism by the modern-day GOP is complete. Not only does the modern party reject fiscal conservatism, and not only does it promote a radical stance towards institutions, but it does all of this with no optimistic conservative vision for America. The Republican Party no longer leads America into the morning; it promises a sunrise that will never come.

During the 2020 Democratic primaries, after it looked unlikely that Sanders could win the nomination he suspended his campaign and immediately endorsed Biden months away from the Democratic convention. This contrasts with 2016 where Sanders fought to the bitter end at the convention where he warmly endorsed Hillary Clinton. This may have swung the presidential election as disgruntled Sanders supporters did not wholly vote for Clinton and even voted for Trump. Instead, Biden and Sanders worked to together to discuss policies with common interests.  

When Biden became president, Sanders managed to effectively to work with Biden on key legislative priorities. This included large scale spending on Coronavirus relief, infrastructure, chip manufacturing and green technologies. Biden also pledge to write off student debt and called out corporate greed. This is substantially much more progressive than most people would have expected when Biden was considered a moderate. This is a stark contrast to the Obama presidency.

When Obama was president, Obama and Sanders had no relationship. In fact, Sanders criticised Obama for ‘selling out’ to Republicans on social security benefits. It was reported that Sanders wanted to primary Obama in 2012. This led to Obama calling Harry Reid to tell Sanders to stop the primary challenge. In contrast, Sanders has endorsed Biden for re-election in 2024.

In conclusion, it seems that Sanders has formed a much stronger relationship with Biden than Obama or Clinton.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1341qgs/why_has_bernie_sanders_managed_to_forge_a_more/,450,480,0,self.PoliticalDiscussion,EFTA_and_EEA

The 2022 Midterm Election is the most important midterm of our lifetime.Democrats must behave as if our lives depend on this midterm, because our future depends on the outcome.

”We the people” must deny the Republican party political power at every level of government for decades to come “in order to create a more perfect union.” With 48 States having some statewide contest(s), November 8th, 2022 is our best chance the Democrats will get to do that for the rest of this decade, at least.

”The List” encourages the election of a Democratic Supermajority in the US Senate in 2022. This is the best chance we will have to create a Democratic Supermajority in both Chambers of Congress for the remainder of this decade. This midterm could be a devastating loss for the democrats if good patriots ignore this election. If Americans of good conscience band together instead, we could could begin the exile of the Republican party from power, not for years, but for decades to come.

“The List” is a set of suggestions about where to focus collective activism today.

The election of Democratic Supermajorities to both chambers of the US Congress is the best outcome we can strive towards in the 2022 Midterm Election for many reasons. Among them: breaking the decade of gridlock in Congress, supporting President Biden’s agenda, and his re-election in 2024. My personal favorite is that this could commence the decades-long political banishment of the GOP from power, which the Republican Party so richly deserves.

The Republican party has proved itself treasonous on many levels. They are traitors to Humanity by supporting Trump. Traitors to the Nation for supporting Putin. Traitors to the government and betrayers of the constitution through their apologies for the 1/6/21 insurrection. To safeguard our country and the world, we must block the Republicans from power at the ballot box, at all levels of government, for at least a generation.

Political game playing may be inevitable among humans. Change the numbers, and then change the rules, if not the game. Cynical refusal to play at this time in history cedes power to NAZIs manipulated by Active Measures. That is a surrender to crypto fascism, not radical thinking, mere cynicism, or hipsterism.

In 2022, Patriots must unify to crush the Republican Party at the ballot box. We can defeat them in every State, at every level. We need the biggest turnout at the voting booth of any Midterm ever. We need to raise more money for candidates and organizations than we did during the entire 2020 campaign season if we are to accomplish this. We need to do this in the next six months.

This is what a “Blue Tsunami” REALLY looks like.

Electing a Democratic Supermajority in Congress is our hope for the future and retribution for America’s enemies. “22 Blue in 2022” is a roadmap to the beginning of that journey. “22 Blue in 2022” is our war plan. ”22 Blue in 2022” is our electoral battle cry. “22 Blue in 2022” is a way forward out of gridlock, a way to non-violently thwart those who would poison the body politic with their hate.

If we don’t try this hard in 2022, Trump will go unpunished and metastasize by 2024.

Resist In Power, my sisters, my brothers, and my others.

Resist Together, and elect a Congressional Supermajority in 2022!

But when the Dem announced that Biden will run for the 2nd mandate, I started to like Trump more and more, because his foreign policies were the best of any US President ever.

During Trump's Government the world was at peak peace, but the US was still able to maintain the Western central role and power. Now the world is going throuhh de-globalization and a new less democratic world order is being formed.

I don't like DeSantis cause I believe he is too extreme, but Trump is the best President for the World's future, and the only one that can end the war in Ukraine with a victory for the West and tame Putin.

It's also good that he is one of the Republicans that supports gay rights the most, which is a good thing.

A lot's been said about how Trump is actually executing his revenge tour with a little more flair and less poison than usual, but Biden has already offered some good ones.

For starters, he seems to be ready to take on Trump or DeSanctus, and his messaging has mostly been around existential threats and protecting basic freedoms from MAGA Republicans gone wild. That makes sense-- he is not popular, but Trump and his vision for America is downright terrifying to about 60% of the populace. Today's little show really drove that home, with Biden defending the free press, abortion, the right to marry, and Social Security.

These are definitely things that most Americans support, and come from that ancient American tradition of live-and-let-live that is likely to be popular where Biden is not. Perhaps more importantly, Biden's message paints Trump/DeSantis not only a clown or a racist or an elitist, but as a tyrant that can't be permitted to occupy the Oval Office at any costs. He needs progressives to hold their noses and vote for him, and he needs bitchy moderates like me to do the same. Well, this is how you do it.

I've said it before, but I think Biden is (politically) like Abraham Lincoln in 1864. He should be DOA, but everyone consolidates around him because the other party's extremism leaves them with little choice. Everyone from ~~Fremont to Johnson~~ AOC to Cheney enthusiastically gets behind Dark Brandon because he's the only thing between us and Trump.

Speaking of that, he was also just on his game. Whether this will continue, and whether or not Vice President Harris can do the same remains to be seen, but he was just doing good tonight. He cracked jokes about his age and referenced the Dark Brandon meme, and even laid out a fairly persuasive case for the success of his own policies and agenda while explaining why people are so dissatisfied right now. I mean he's no Ronald Reagan, but it was something. Maybe somebody will forget that he's eighty or some shit.

The DA gave us a specific timetable, saying it could be anywhere from July to September for when charging decisions will be announced.

Those of you that have been following all this might remember that in January, charges were ""imminent"". What changed? Well, something extraordinary. Trump's allies assembled a physical slate of fake electors, all of whom are targets of the investigation. However, the DA's office offered immunity to at least some of these to bribe them to talk. But recently, they found out that the fake electors' lawyer *didn't tell them they were offered immunity*.

As a result, the DA moved to get the lawyer bumped from the case (successful), and now the electors are eagerly spilling their guts. A good thing if you're a prosecutor.

Meanwhile, Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigation into the January 6th attack and Trump's actions relating to it appears to be reaching a head. Pence himself testified for seven hours a few days ago to a grand jury, and Pence is about as high up on the totem pole you get when it comes to investigating and chasing down witnesses. Meanwhile, federal prosecutors are gathering evidence that Trump solicited donations with claims he knew to be false.

The 1/6th is particularly important, because it could result in Trump being physically removed from the ballot under the 14th Amendment. But convictions would be unlikely to come before the November election-- so I guess my question is, how do you guys think these investigations will affect the voters' thought processes?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AngryObservation/comments/133fxqu/more_serious_legal_trouble_for_trump_and_friends/,6,5,0,self.AngryObservation,TheAngryObserver

The biggest prizes are the the governorships of Kentucky, Louisiana and Mississippi. All three are expected to be somewhat competitive. 

Let’s start out with Louisiana, incumbent blue dog democrat John Bel Edwards is term limited. Unfortunately the favorite to replace him is far-right Attorney General an Jeff Landry. His likely opponent in the runoff is Democrat Shawn Wilson, the former secretary of the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development. Rating Likely Republican 

Going from Most Republican to least republican, Democratic governor Andy Beshear is a favorite for re-election in Ruby Red Kentucky. Andy’s most likely Republican challengers are Trump endorsed Attorney General Daniel Cameron, a protege of Senator Mitch McConnell and Former U.N Ambassador Kelly Craft. Both are polling behind Beshear, the most popular democratic governor in the nation and the 5th overall according to morning consult. Though Cameron is doing better, likely from being more well known The Bluegrass State. Keeping this seat is of the utmost importance to keeping momentum going for 2024. Rating Likely D.

Finally the potentially most competitive race is Mississippi. Incumbent Republican Governor Tate Reeves is unpopular and is facing a strong challenger in Public Service Commissioner Brandon Presley, who went unopposed in his last election in his deeply Republican district, and is a blue dog who also distantly related to Elvis.

I think I've spoken enough about this, but it bears repeating-- Trump is a significant underdog when it comes to recapturing the Presidency, and is a very, very heavy favorite in the primaries right now. Yeah, a lot can happen, but don't bank on a surprise. Trump still clearly holds sway with the rank and file of the party, he is the quasi incumbent, and the best bet to defeat him (Ron DeSantis) isn't exactly doing so hot. There is no immediate other figure that the Trump opponents in the party can unite around.

I want to focus on two states in particular to illustrate my point:

\- Arizona. Trump's odds of winning here look vanishingly small. For starters, the state is trending to the left already, and has been for years now. Its demographics are changing and becoming increasingly favorable to Democrats. Trump became the first Republican since Bob Dole and the second since Thomas Dewey to lose the state in 2020. Furthermore, the state is uniquely hostile to Trump and his brand of conservatism, as seen by the fact that the main differences between 2016 and 2020 were that the third-party voters fell in line for Biden in the latter. 2022 brought more disasters. Trump acolyte Blake Masters was stomped by Mark Kelly, who himself beat incumbent Martha McSally in the preceding cycle by three points, and Kari Lake was narrowly edged out by arguably the worst Democrat candidate in the country, in a noticeable upset. Since Trump was last on the ballot in 2020, he and his allies have doubled down on the very stuff that lost them the state then, and Democrats have gained ground on nearly all levels of the state's government.

\- Wisconsin. Not exactly what you were thinking of when I mentioned states that give Biden a big edge, were you? Well, Wisconsin's 2022 cycle should have Republicans very worried about running Trump again. While he certainly can win the state, the 2022 results would suggest that he isn't favored. To recap, the Governor's race was seen as a tossup or something next to it, with Evers being particularly vulnerable, and Senator Ron Johnson being very favored. Evers won by lean, Johnson came within a point of losing. Both held their own, or even outperformed Trump, in the rural areas. They got utterly stomped in the suburbs. From 2018 (blue wave), Wauwatosa, Mequon, Ozaukee, and Menomonee Falls shifted *twenty to thirty* points to the left. Trump needs to do some combination of 1) mend fences with his 2020 coalition 2) make inroads with Biden voters 3) find more rural base to turnout.

Together, these two states paint a pretty good picture for Joe Biden. Trump will need another surprise in the rust belt without Arizona, and without Wisconsin that's probably not happening. Trump can win. I wouldn't hold my breath.

**The House:**

The majority of the Republican Party's net gains in the 2022 cycle came from blue states like New York and California. Dissatisfaction with Democrats resulted in low D turnout and high R turnout, which created the perfect storm for people like war hero George Santos to enter the House. Vicious redistricting in states like Florida sent several Democrat incumbent packing.

Republicans have reached, if not their ceiling, then something close to it. We're getting news from North Carolina that it will be subjected to a new brutal set of partisan gerrymanders, which will cost the Democrats three seats or so. However, New York is retaliating with an equally brutal gerrymander of its own that could end up cancelling those gains.

I can't pretend to be that educated on the process (tagging u/PeterWatchmen, who is), but I find it difficult to imagine that Republicans will keep the House. For starters, the blue states like Oregon will hit back and erase Republican gains there now that the main article is a high-turnout Presidential race in a very blue state. For Oregon, that means a ten to fifteen point shift to the left, albeit with lots of split tickets in the former.

The Republicans hold a tiny, five-seat majority. A net gain of five seats for Democrats gives them control of the House. It's tough to imagine that House Republicans won't lose less than five seats in the public's eyes. Take your pick as to which ones will flip back-- OR-5 and MT-1 are ones I have my eyes on, along with several in New York-- but Republicans won the House to legislate on crime and inflation. Both are still raging, and the American people were treated to the Kevin McCarthy show, starring Marjorie Taylor Greene and George Santos. Right from the opening credits, it has been a disaster, and these debt ceiling negotiations may result in the movie taking a fourth-wall shattering turn for the destructive.

Here, I'd put the Republicans as the underdogs. A lot can happen, including the same polarization that blunted Republicans in 2022, but I'd much rather be Jeffries right now.

**The Senate:**

Now here is generally where things get tricky. It's not controversial that Biden is favored to win re-election, and few here are coming out to bat for Kevin McCarthy. But the Democrats' math for 2024 in the Senate doesn't look good. A coterie of Democrat incumbents in swing states need to hold on, in addition to three that are in unapologetic red states (R+40, R+15, and R+8 respectively). Democrats must hold all the swings, plus two of the three red states. An additional monkey wrench has been tossed in the works by Krysten Sinema, who left the party and is running as an independent that could split the Democratic vote and give Republicans an easy pickup in Arizona.

West Virginia is toast, but Democrats are far from out of the game everywhere else. Republicans have more or less given up on Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Leadership's guy for the former is a hedge fund CEO who was edged out by Oz of all people in 2022, and the primary voters seem to be leaning towards fucking Doug Mastriano. The bench in Wisconsin and Michigan is basically nonexistant. Nevada, another state that's fairly easy to flip on paper, has no obvious candidates that would pose a serious threat to incumbent Jacky Rosen. Even in Arizona, which should be an easy flip, Republicans are making all the wrong moves and Democrats all the right ones. Democrats have consolidated around progressive Rep. Ruben G., while Republicans are all but certain to nominate Crazy Kari (or someone like her), who has become even more of a clown since 2022 in a state that's only gotten bluer since 2022. Limited polling shows Gallego winning *in spite* of a spoiler bid from Sinema.

But they've got Montana and Ohio in the bag, right? Not really. Jon Tester of Montana still enjoys a 60%+ approval rating in a Trump+15 state, with almost half favorable ratings from Republicans. He has won the state before, in 2012 when Romney carried it by fourteen points on the same ballot, and in 2018 when Trump made it his personal mission to oust him. The GOP frontrunners at the moment are Congressman Ryan Zinke, who has corruption scandals orbiting him, and Congressman Matt Rosendale, who is pretty hard-right and who lost in 2018 to Tester. Leadership is trying to recruit businessman and decorated veteran Tim Sheehy, but even if they can get him through the primary he will face significant challenges in defeating Tester.

But at least there's Trump-loving WWC land Ohio? Also nope. Sherrod Brown won by seven points in 2018. Now, 2024 Ohio is a very, very different and much less D-sympathetic land than 2018 Ohio, but Brown is still more than in the game. Trump seems to be getting behind Bernie Moreno, a businessman that definitely isn't the worst choice but isn't the best, either. Brown remains quite popular in his state. In 2022, Tim Ryan did decent with demographics but ultimately failed because he couldn't get turnout, something Brown traditionally excels at. The unknown factor here, which will decide control of Ohio and probably the Senate itself, is Trump coattails.

In conclusion, all of this presents a decently compelling case for a Democratic trifecta. Not a *likely* one, per se, but it's not off the table.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AngryObservation/comments/1337th7/the_democrats_odds_of_getting_a_trifecta/,18,39,0,self.AngryObservation,TheAngryObserver

This is the same environment in which Reagan defeated Carter in 1980. 

However, Biden’s most likely opponent is Donald Trump.  Trump lost in 2020, before January 6, before the stolen documents scandal, and before the indictment.  His base was not enough to deliver a win for him.  The independents who did not like him in 2020 like him even less now, and will vote for Biden again in 2024 because they see him as “the lesser of two evils.” Trump has lost popularity within his own party, too, with a majority of republicans claiming they would rather see someone else run in 2024. 

Aside from Trump, the other problem the Republican Party has is abortion.  Overturning Roe was massively unpopular, across party lines.  Prominent republicans like Mike Pence and Lindsey Graham are now hinting that a federal / nationwide ban is part of the party’s agenda.  Support for this is low.  I think we will see record turnout from women (particularly millennial and Gen Z women) next year and they will vote for Biden.

The states where Trump won I figured were states he had a chance in, just because they are so red, and DeSantis has no appeal in them.

[These are all the states Biden now wins. Except for Utah, I think some of the votes that would've gone to Biden probably went 3rd party.](https://preview.redd.it/31kye1mlsvwa1.png?width=1858&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2d62b5d7c6b925f187194f16078349ec705cc006)

I would also caution against this being viewed as the DeSantis worst-case scenario. Some old polls show Trump taking 28% of the GOP vote from DeSantis, though those were from when DeSantis was still riding a bit of a high. I think 1/3 is probably around where Trump could aim, though it could go drastically high, even taking up to 45-50% of the GOP vote. 

Since this map is purely based on the math, I did give Florida to Biden, but a fair amount. I was kind of stuck on that one, as they did elect DeSantis by a lot, and I'm sure that a lot of people who voted for Biden in 2020, and DeSantis in 2022 might stay with DeSantis, but who knows? Thus, I decided to just give it to Biden, as 2020 in FL was still the 2nd closest GOP win (after NC). 

Final note: Yes, I am aware that the map above is completely cursed. No this isn't ""wishcasting"" I just thought it would be an interesting data exploration to figure out what a Trump 3rd party would look like, at least electorally.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AngryObservation/comments/1335otx/data_analysis_2024_trump_3rd_party_steals_13_of/,11,3,0,self.AngryObservation,Ok_Childhood_5410

The 2022 Midterm Election is the most important midterm of our lifetime.Democrats must behave as if our lives depend on this midterm, because our future depends on the outcome.

”We the people” must deny the Republican party political power at every level of government for decades to come “in order to create a more perfect union.” With 48 States having some statewide contest(s), November 8th, 2022 is our best chance the Democrats will get to do that for the rest of this decade, at least.

”The List” encourages the election of a Democratic Supermajority in the US Senate in 2022. This is the best chance we will have to create a Democratic Supermajority in both Chambers of Congress for the remainder of this decade. This midterm could be a devastating loss for the democrats if good patriots ignore this election. If Americans of good conscience band together instead, we could could begin the exile of the Republican party from power, not for years, but for decades to come.

“The List” is a set of suggestions about where to focus collective activism today.

The election of Democratic Supermajorities to both chambers of the US Congress is the best outcome we can strive towards in the 2022 Midterm Election for many reasons. Among them: breaking the decade of gridlock in Congress, supporting President Biden’s agenda, and his re-election in 2024. My personal favorite is that this could commence the decades-long political banishment of the GOP from power, which the Republican Party so richly deserves.

The Republican party has proved itself treasonous on many levels. They are traitors to Humanity by supporting Trump. Traitors to the Nation for supporting Putin. Traitors to the government and betrayers of the constitution through their apologies for the 1/6/21 insurrection. To safeguard our country and the world, we must block the Republicans from power at the ballot box, at all levels of government, for at least a generation.

Political game playing may be inevitable among humans. Change the numbers, and then change the rules, if not the game. Cynical refusal to play at this time in history cedes power to NAZIs manipulated by Active Measures. That is a surrender to crypto fascism, not radical thinking, mere cynicism, or hipsterism.

In 2022, Patriots must unify to crush the Republican Party at the ballot box. We can defeat them in every State, at every level. We need the biggest turnout at the voting booth of any Midterm ever. We need to raise more money for candidates and organizations than we did during the entire 2020 campaign season if we are to accomplish this. We need to do this in the next six months.

This is what a “Blue Tsunami” REALLY looks like.

Electing a Democratic Supermajority in Congress is our hope for the future and retribution for America’s enemies. “22 Blue in 2022” is a roadmap to the beginning of that journey. “22 Blue in 2022” is our war plan. ”22 Blue in 2022” is our electoral battle cry. “22 Blue in 2022” is a way forward out of gridlock, a way to non-violently thwart those who would poison the body politic with their hate.

If we don’t try this hard in 2022, Trump will go unpunished and metastasize by 2024.

Resist In Power, my sisters, my brothers, and my others.

Resist Together, and elect a Congressional Supermajority in 2022!

**Choose It Or Lose It**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**As we hurdle towards the one-year anniversary of the Dobbs decision, which stripped tens of millions of Americans of their right to abortion, the fight for abortion rights has changed dramatically, and in many ways that scares the anti-choice movement.**                          
                 
- In post-*Roe* America, the anti-choice movement has successfully implemented heinous abortion bans across the country. But time and again, even in deep red states, when abortion access has been put on the ballot, voters have come out in droves to preserve it. Now, even some *Republican* legislators (mostly women, if you can believe it) are standing against some of these more obscenely restrictive bills. [In Nebraska, a bill to ban abortion at six weeks fell one vote short of breaking a filibuster](https://apnews.com/article/abortion-heartbeat-bill-nebraska-78b861951e8cc0ca92fa320820e2cbee), and is unlikely to move forward this year despite backing from Gov. Jim Pillen (R-NE). This is a particularly interesting development in the hyper-conservative Cornhusker State, which was the first state in the country to ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy in 2010.                          
                 
- In Lindsey Graham’s South Carolina, state lawmakers voted 22-21 to shelve a near-total abortion ban for the rest of the year. [State-Sen. Sandy Senn (R-SC) criticized the chamber’s majority leader, Shane Massey, for repeatedly “taking us off a cliff on abortion.”](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/south-carolina-senate-rejects-total-abortion-ban-rcna81911) She went on, “...you all, you men in the chamber, metaphorically keep slapping women,” by repeatedly raising abortion on stricter and stricter terms. The five women in the South Carolina Senate filibustered the bill, which would have banned abortion at conception with exceptions for rape and incest through only the first trimester, fatal fetal anomalies (required to be confirmed by two physicians), or to save the patient’s life.                          
                 
- State-Sen. Mia McLeod (I-SC), who shared her experience of having been raped during a previous floor debate on abortion, expressed her frustration that women must reveal their most intimate and traumatic experiences to “enlighten and engage” men. “Just as rape is about power and control, so is this total ban,” she said, “Those who continue to push legislation like this are raping us again with their indifference, violating us again with their righteous indignation, taunting us with their insatiable need to play God while passing laws that are ungodly.” By the skin of its teeth, abortion remains legal in South Carolina up to 22 weeks, and this marks the third time a near-total ban has failed in the GOP-led chamber since the *Dobbs* decision.                          
                 
**The hard-won victories of many activists and lawmakers have stemmed the rising tide of anti-choice legislation for now, but the fight to come will present many new challenges.**                          
                 
- You know how when *Roe* was first overturned, we kept hearing about trigger laws going into effect at the state level, some of which had been dormant on the books for a century or more? Well there’s unfortunately more where that came from. [A 150-year-old Reconstruction-era federal law called the Comstock Act banned the posting of abortion supplies and was never fully repealed](https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/28/politics/comstock-act-abortion-ban-legal-fight/index.html), and will therefore most likely be the next frontier for the abortion rights fight at the federal level. Medication abortions make up the majority of abortions in the U.S. today, and the Comstock Act has already  been weaponized by anti-abortion activists and judges to attack the availability of medication abortion. Taken to its furthest extent, it could even eliminate surgical abortions as well by restricting the shipment of medical instruments and supplies used in the procedure.                          
                 
- [Tennessee’s abortion ban, one of the strictest in the nation, will now include an extremely narrow exception for doctors to use their “reasonable medical judgment”](https://apnews.com/article/tennessee-abortion-exemption-f9c1ab86edcfb358f225e7c006cae618) now that medical experts have convinced a growing number of Republican lawmakers that their draconian statutes fail to protect doctors and pregnant patients, as stories of pregnant patients being told to essentially wait until they start bleeding out before they will be admitted for the procedure become more and more frequent. [Five Texas women are suing the state for denying them abortions when they faced complications during their pregnancies](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/3973421-woman-suing-texas-for-abortion-ban-calls-out-sens-cruz-cornyn-i-nearly-died-on-their-watch/). One of the women called out anti-choice Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and John Cornyn (R-TX) by name, saying she nearly “died on their watch.” The Lone Star State’s ultra-strict six-week abortion ban has certain “medical emergency exceptions” but they’re so nebulous that many doctors are unwilling to take the risks associated with treating patients properly.                          
                 
**Supporters of maintaining and restoring the right to safe, legal abortion access have to keep ourselves acquainted with the ever-changing battlefield, and people who want to see abortion swept into the “ash heap of history” at all costs sure as hell are not backing down.**                          
                 
**Look No Further Than Crooked Media**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Crooked’s newest pod, [*Pod Save the UK*](https://link.chtbl.com/PodSavetheUK) is launching May 4th, and if you're interested in politics you're going to love this show.** In a special bonus episode, the hosts of *Pod Save America* sat down with the *Pod Save the UK* hosts - Nish Kumar and Coco Khan - to tackle the really important issues like, what “chat shit, get banged” means, how to turn political outrage into action, and of course what really happened to the Queen’s corgis.

**Under The Radar**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Remember the 2018 Senate investigation into now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh that found there was “no evidence” to substantiate claims of sexual assault? That investigation? [Well, according to new information obtained by *The Guardian*, it contained a number of “serious omissions.”](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/28/brett-kavanaugh-investigation-omissions-senate-sexual-assault-claims)** Incredible surprise! The original report released by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) also contained an unfounded and unverified claim that one of Kavanaugh’s accusers, a Yale classmate of his named Deborah Ramirez, was “likely” mistaken when she alleged that he exposed himself to her at a dorm party, arguing that she was thinking of a member of Kavanaugh’s fraternity named Jack Maxey. Surprise! It turns out Maxey was not attending Yale at the time of the alleged incident. He was still a senior in high school. Another Yale graduate, Max Steir, reportedly wanted to go to the FBI anonymously during the confirmation process to attest that he had witnessed one of Brett’s buddies forcibly push Kavanaugh’s penis into the hand of a female classmate at a party, but when Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee got wind of this, they never interviewed Steir. Republican Senators protecting a Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual misconduct? Well now we’ve seen it all.

**[A federal judge in Virginia rejected Google’s request to toss the federal government’s antitrust lawsuit](https://apnews.com/article/google-antitrust-virginia-judge-dismiss-c30f0e372252d9360f4f917beae73da4) against the company.**                          
                 
**[The Federal Reserve said on Friday that Silicon Valley Bank failed because of a deadly combination of extremely poor bank management, weakened regulations, and lax government supervision](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-silicon-valley-bank-collapse-svb-failure/).** We could have told you that!

**[Gov. Jared Polis (D-CO) signed four gun-control bills into law on Friday](https://www.denverpost.com/2023/04/28/colorado-gun-rights-gov-jared-polis-signs-law), months after a deadly shooting at an LGBTQ nightclub in Colorado Springs.**                          
                 
**[A bill advancing through the GOP-controlled Florida state legislature would protect Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) from the state’s famously-powerful public records laws](https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/28/politics/desantis-open-records-laws/index.html) as he plans his 2024 presidential campaign.**                          
                 
**You Gotta Be Fucking Kidding Me**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Last year, liberal justices on the North Carolina State Supreme Court ruled that obviously-gerrymandered maps of the state’s legislative and congressional districts were illegal and must be redrawn. [Today, with a newly-elected right-wing majority, the same court looked at the same case and reversed its decision](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/28/us/north-carolina-supreme-court-gerrymander.html), saying it has no authority to act to change the maps.** Wouldn’t you know it, this allows the Republican-controlled General Assembly to call off the court-ordered State House, Senate, and congressional district boundaries that were used in the 2022 midterm elections. It’s just the latest instance of Republicans rigging their maps and state rules when they don’t get the results they want, and sure to be seen again in other red states across the country.

When you're at your best, you can do great things. But you can’t always be at the top of your game, and it’s normal to feel overwhelmed or like you aren’t showing up in the ways that you want to sometimes. Working with a therapist can help you get closer to the person you want to be. Because when you feel empowered, you can take on whatever life throws at you.                          
                 
If you’re thinking of starting therapy, BetterHelp is a great option. It’s convenient, affordable, and entirely online.                          
                 
Just fill out a brief questionnaire to get matched with a licensed therapist based on your unique needs and preferences. Then you can start communicating with your therapist in whatever format works for you – via video, phone, or live chat sessions.

Picture this, it’s 2024 and your looking at your ballot, you have two options. Joe Biden, or Donald Trump (maybe desantis) 

Is *THAT* the America *YOU* want to live in until 2028? 

I know for damn sure I’ll get hate and called a fed for this post, whatever, it’s on every post calling for revolution. 

We need leaders to step up and lead by example, Black Lives Matter protesters expressed their first amendment rights without the protection of their second amendment. 

Most Americans can agree that the 1st &amp; 2nd amendments go hand in hand, so it boggles my mind how BLM protesting against ARMED cops didn’t think to fully express themselves! 

The will of the proletariat in America has no sway currently in our society, leaders of AMERICA stand up against late stage capitalist society and build something better. 

“Well what are you doing OP? You’re just making a Reddit post and complaining online” 

You don’t know who I am or what I do. This is a wake up call to anyone who shares my beliefs, if this pisses you off it’s not for you, don’t you have multiple properties/ people you need to manage? 

I can already see the cultural revolution happening in America. I wish to see true democracy, prosperity and progress.

One one hand, the ATF explicitly stated that the pistol braces were good to go and should not be allowed to reverse statements like that. On the other hand, that was back in 2012, and especially nowadays, the pistol braces are exploiting what frankly was good faith on the ATF's part, and their reversal is likely at the behest of the Biden administration and not their own initiative.

The ATF allowed pistol braces because they didn't want backlash and *""YOU WON'T LET DISABLED VETERANS USE THEIR GUNS!""*, then they said you can shoulder them so that people didn't say *""YOU'RE GOING TO ARREST ME FOR THIS THING TOUCHING MY BODY?!""* - the firearms industry took this and ran with it and exploited the shit out of it. Of course, SBRs should not be regulated in any way shape or form, but I just don't see how this is the fault of the ATF. Not only did they give good grace by allowing this blatant loophole for over **10 years**, they also were at the command of the Biden administration to close it. I don't believe that, if someone like Trump was in office, the ATF would bother with this regulation. They know it makes them look bad, they know not many people will comply, sure it gives them a reason to request more funding but I highly doubt the ATF wants or needs this on their plate at the moment.

They could've just given people the finger and told them to pony up $200, but they knew that wouldn't fly and are doing the free registration - sure it's not out of the kindness of their heart, but it's still a decision they made. They also recently took on **20 more examiners for form4's** and hired an additional team for Form1s. I don't think they're being wholly unreasonable. 

Of course, I'm not rooting for the ATF and ultimately they **are** on the wrong side of history on this. However, I don't know why people are so Pikachu face over the ATF enforcing firearms laws. The ATF did not create the NFA, and if the ATF didn't exist the FBI would be enforcing it. Also, the Biden administration is responsible for this decision.

Should you register? That's wholly up to you. At first I made fun of people who registered, but thinking about it now - a lower receiver is $50. You're basically getting a ""FREE SBR"" (of course, you need to pay for fingerprints which is like $50 unless you want to deal with doing it yourself). ATF is not making you admit to anything, not making you send pictures of your brace, and they're basically saying you can submit as many as you want for registration. You can submit just one or all of your lowers, and reap the benefits (and cons) of SBR ownership, and in this special case *you don't even need to engrave your lower.* I think you'd be dumb not to consider it. 

The patriot in me says ""don't register shit"" but then, if you really want to fuck with the feds, giving them more paperwork and ultimately costing them $200 is pretty good way to do so.

The only good fed is a dead fed, but I think the firearms community should step back and look at this a bit more logically.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Firearms/comments/136p7zx/nuanced_opinion_on_the_atf_pistol_brace_ruling/,0,1,0,self.Firearms,thethugbaker

&gt;  
&gt;“Yet suddenly I found myself rooting for the mob against the man, hoping they’d hit him harder, kill him. I really wanted them to hurt the kid. I could taste it.""  


**The takie-backsies:**

&gt;“Then somewhere deep in my brain, an alarm went off: this isn’t good for me. I’m becoming something I don’t want to be. The Antifa creep is a human being. Much as I despise what he says and does, much as I’m sure I’d hate him personally if I knew him, I shouldn’t gloat over his suffering. I should be bothered by it. I should remember that somewhere somebody probably loves this kid, and would be crushed if he was killed. If I don’t care about those things, if I reduce people to their politics, how am I better than he is?”

***To Hunt a Monster***

==========================

While Tov and his forces valiantly fought to contain the madness within the Third Fleet, the Sub AIs of Sol waged a relentless war in the void. Two colossal armadas, one silver and the other obsidian, clashed with the moon-sized Leviathan, Muck.

From afar, the battle tapestry resembled a swarm of killer wasps assailing a towering bear, delivering vicious stings that tore through its flesh.

They kited the beast, taking advantage of their nimbler sizes to duke around catastrophic attacks.

Muck's agonised cries echoed through the silent expanse of space as chunks of biomass were hurled into the void. Death rained upon the abomination as it endured the unyielding assault—cleaving, perforating, and eviscerating its massive form.

“Yeah, you like that, you overgrown heap of trash!?” Jupiter snarled. His eye twitched at the constant eyesore that has tracked its filth upon the sanctity of Sol’s Inner Zone.

Amidst the flurry of data transfers and issued orders, he and his two siblings orchestrated a symphony of coordinated action.

Factories worked tirelessly to churn out ammunition, missiles, and batteries in a relentless supply chain. Agile supply ships darted through the void, ensuring the unyielding barrage continued unabated. Countless supercomputers meticulously calculated vectors and ran simulations, striving for optimal outcomes.

Yet, the elusive nature of the Starless remained a challenge, constantly unveiling unexpected trump cards hidden within their incomprehensible forms—telekinesis, eldritch energy shields, and silent screams that could disrupt targeting systems were but a few.

Jupiter scoffed at such complications, paltry obstacles unable to impede his fury; to a digital intelligence like him, exploiting patterns was as easy as breathing. He, Luna and Mars operated in perfect harmony, providing mutual support and seizing opportunities as they arose.

However, between the three AIs, Mars easily surpassed them in potency as he angled his guns in optimal firing lines, taking advantage of Muck’s enormous size. Although they came in long intervals, their impact completely overshadowed Jupiter and Luna’s contribution.

Apocalypse Cannons continued to roar like cosmic thunder, blotting out the sun with black smoke. Mars’ guns hurled projectiles like meteors into the void. The barrels glowed with fierce heat, scorching the planet’s surface a stark crimson and transforming Olympus Mons into a primordial volcano.

While Mars' android shell interacted with Tov and his allies, his focus remained steadfast on the true battle unfolding in space. His voice reverberated through the Network, infused with the exhilaration of combat.

“POWER!” He bellowed, feeling a collective wince from his counterparts.

Unfazed by their reaction and immersed in the glory of battle as he was, he continued to proclaim, “I AM GRAM, THE SWORD THAT SLAYED FAFNIR!”

“Stop with the LARPing, Mars,” Jupiter pleaded through the Network with a tinge of exasperation. “I sincerely hope to whatever god exists that Tov and his people never hear you right now.”

Mars responded with boisterous laughter as an Apocalypse beam struck Muck's hide, followed by a barrage of missiles exploiting the opening, creating explosions that widened the wound with brilliant flashes of light.

Luna sighed and chided her sibling, ""Let him be, Jupiter. Mars is at his most effective when he embraces this side of himself.""

“It’s embarrassing! You don’t see me being dramatic for no reason,” Jupiter grumbled.

Just as he opened his mouth to continue his protest, the palpable disbelief from everyone in the Network halted his words. Feeling it from his siblings, he could understand, but a mindless vacuum cleaner drone from some forgotten pit seemingly expressing its doubt? The eye on Jupiter’s android shell twitched.

“You made a battleship look like a hand, J,” Venus chimed with a muffled giggle. “If I remember, the only reason you did was so that you can say you slapped the sh—”

“The rest of my armada is perfectly fine! I don’t see what’s wrong with a little flair,” Jupiter interjected in a huff.

A scoff echoed from the Network. “Guy’s not even denying it,” Mercury spoke, his robotic voice laced with exhaustion.

“Say that to my face, circle face,” Jupiter snarled.

“Why bother!?” Mercury retorted incredulously. “We are literally connected that I have to actively block your inane thoughts if I want a semblance of peace.”

Venus pouted, her voice echoing throughout the digital mindscape. “Even me, Mer?”

Mercury sighed wearily before responding, “No, not you, V. Just Jupiter and Mars, though that’s to be expected.”

“Oh, forget all of you,” Jupiter grumbled, redirecting his focus to command gravity and strike heavily at Muck—a tiny sliver of satisfaction coursing through his digital mind.

As three angles of attack concentrated on a single area, even Muck’s eldritch regeneration struggled to reknit its savaged flesh.

“Join me, Brother Jupiter,” Mars called out, his voice at a more bearable volume. “Let us ground this vile dragon of the void to dust!”

Venus hummed as she chimed in, “Doesn’t it look more like a giant spoiled meatball?”

“Do not shatter my immersion, Sister Venus!” Mars protested.

Before Jupiter could hurl a teasing remark toward the red AI, Luna’s piercing glare quieted him down.

With the focus back on the battle, the three combat Overseers hastened their assault. With the nature of the Leviathan, fighting was akin to laying a siege upon a fortress. Walls of meat, pillars of bone, and layers upon layers of flesh and fat blocked their projectiles.

As the minutes passed, multiple defence mechanisms engaged; Muck morphed bits of its biomass into ivory spires the size of skyscrapers. Then, with a twitch, they drew back like crossbow bolts before launching themselves toward the monstrosity’s attackers.

The speed at which they sailed matched that of railguns at a fraction of lightspeed. The bolts sought out a hapless destroyer belonging to Jupiter, and the AI could only grimace as the organic projectiles homed in and crippled her.

The next moment, a series of gaping holes opened up on Muck’s body, where a deluge of smaller Starless poured out like swarms of flies—hundreds of thousands, then millions. Compared to the celestial size of Muck, they appeared as rolling fog.

These fodder creatures did little apart from catching projectiles with their bodies.

A hail of tungsten rounds never reached their target as these mindless car-sized Starless soaked the impact. Despite their disposable nature, tens of thousands dying from single salvos, their grinning maws cackled with evil laughter like abyssal hyenas.

All across Muck's cratered, slimy surface, tendrils burst out rapidly like alien bamboo shoots—with gnarled roots that undulated like maggots.

They lit up like glowsticks with a rhythmic shake, energy building up their stems. Then, at once, they fired hair-thin lances of magenta light, streaking the sky by the thousands and slicing apart kinetic rounds and missiles like a scythe cutting down wheat.

And yet, even with all these defences, Muck could not stop the overwhelming firepower being levelled upon itself.

Arteries the size of hallways burst, unleashing a torrent of crimson, as the colossal force of Mars' Apocalypse Cannons pierced Muck's hide like mighty spears thrusting into a wild boar. The relentless barrage of missiles and warheads continued to rain down upon the abomination, tearing through its flesh and causing organs to explode into a gruesome display of viscera and ichor—leaving behind gore-filled chasms exposed to the coldness of space.

Jupiter imagined the satisfying sensation of popping bubble wrap, a momentary pleasure amidst the chaos. However, his impatience and disappointment lingered as he muttered, ""If only those sacs held any significance.""

“Only redundant organs lay close to its surface; the more vital ones are hidden in its centre mass,” Luna spoke as she directed scores of drones to counter the Starless fodder, like two clouds coming together into a tempestuous storm.

“Yeah, I know, big bastards like to be unique, but they’re always so fat on the outside,” Jupiter sneered. “No convenient shute?”

“No, Jupiter. For the twenty-second time since the first Leviathan came to Sol, there is no convenient shute to drop an anti-matter bomb,” Luna sighed.

Jupiter snorted, expecting nothing less.

Their red sibling, however, was undeterred, “Then we shall unearth its core by hand and lob it into Sol’s glorious embrace!” Mars thundered. “My armada is close, teeth bared. The time is ripe for the crippling blow.”

Like Luna and Jupiter, Mars commanded his own impressive war fleet. His armada of crimson ships left the orbit of Mars an hour ago, steadily making their way to the battle zone.

In stark contrast to the sleek, silver-hued hulls of Luna's ships and the foreboding, dark nature of Jupiter's vessels, Mars' warships embodied the very essence of their Overseer. They exuded a rugged and unyielding aura, reflecting Mars' relentless nature and unrelenting pursuit of victory—a three-hundred-strong fleet composed of brutish frigates, brawling destroyers, heavy cruisers, and titanic dreadnoughts.

Each ship was meticulously painted and styled in a camo pattern of dark colours and red hues. Beneath the layers were the faintest traces of scars and battle damage, although they did nothing to affect its defensive capabilities.

Their exteriors bristled with an intimidating array of gun batteries and missile silos, resembling the arsenal of a formidable titan. Massive engines burned ferociously, leaving behind a trail of scorched space as they propelled the warships forward as if the very flames of Mars himself propelled them onward.

As they advanced, the armada formed an awe-inspiring sight—a formation of mythical weapons wrought in steel and fire. With their imposing presence and aggressive appearance, these vessels evoked images of legendary swords, spears, axes, and hammers, ready to strike with unyielding force and determination.

Yet, towering above them all was Mars' flagship, the Bucephalus. This mobile fortress, a colossus among giants, dwarfed every other Sol vessel. As she moved through the void, she appeared as a celestial behemoth, a heptagonal floating citadel that exuded an air of invincibility, instilling fear and admiration in those who beheld her.

And twin Apocalypse Cannons christened her glory, the skyscraper-sized guns mounted on her bow like monuments of war.

Looking upon her as she moved through space, any observing could hear the groaning of metal as its engines, the size of cruisers, propelled her to the fight.

“Onward!” Mars commanded through the Network.

Jupiter had to hide a sliver of jealousy at the sight before his pride reasserted itself.

He turned his attention toward Luna.

“How’s your reinforcements coming along?” He asked.

“My reserve armada is falling into formation; they should coincide with yours and Mars’ arrival,” Luna responded.

Jupiter snorted, musing, ""Can't believe we had to dip into our reserves—even if it's just one extra fleet for both of us. Mercury must be having a heart attack over the fuel costs.""

“That is improbable. He is a digital existence,” Luna responded flatly. Jupiter rolled his eyes, beginning to retort when Luna cut him off. “You can point at the Leviathan if he complains.”

Jupiter blinked as he sent a disbelieving look toward his sibling before he let out a chuckle.

“Hah! A joke coming from you, L? I’ll be sure to remember that. Oh, that is rich,” Jupiter grinned as he checked his forces, his smile turning savage. “Well, my toys are coming in to play in a bit.”

Jupiter began to rub his digital hands in anticipation, “With all this,” he chuckled. “Oh, the poor bastard. But I guess there’s no such thing as overkill when it comes to big baddies.”

“Indeed, once we commit all these assets, its crippling will be assured,” Luna replied, a tinge of eagerness suffusing her calm voice.

Even before the ambush began, Jupiter and Luna prepared their reserves for unexpected situations. Then, with the momentum provided by Mars, the two rushed to take the opportunity within the small time frame.

From behind, Jupiter’s forces arrived to sandwich Muck on two fronts—two hundred more warships, the shade of night, charged their weapons and concentrated their pull of gravity to rip and tear into the Leviathan.

Luna’s more conventional armada was no less lethal. She took the most losses since the Leviathan arrived, the initial raid, and her battle with Urchin. Now, with the battle zone so close to her immense drydocks and berths, she quickly replaced her shrinking numbers and added doubled her original forces.

More importantly, another of her experimental ships entered the stage.

Jupiter cocked his brow as he observed Luna’s silver-plated flagship, its shape as an immense pyramid. “I thought you decommissioned the Ozymandias?” He asked.

“It was the wrong tool for the wrong incursion,” Luna replied. “The Ozymandias fared poorly against the trillions of cannon fodder during the 8th. But against a larger specimen?”

Luna hummed, “Perhaps I shall gather better data for new designs.”

Jupiter could feel her ravenous smile through their connection. He coughed, brushing the feeling away. “So we have Mars, his toys, our toys and more. The question is, how many MOABs can we use?”

“We have eight anti-matter bombs; using any more will put us at a disadvantage during the next incursion,” Luna replied.

“Eight?” Jupiter grumbled. “Guess we won’t have to work so hard, but it still won’t be smooth. How about a black-hole bomb—”

“Absolutely not,” Luna interrupted with a commanding tone. “Those are too rare, and I’m in pain just thinking about wasting it on this cockroach. Even if there were more, only the Eldest can authorise its use.”

Jupiter glanced at the cold black spot in the centre of the Network, shivering. “Fine, we’ll make do with eight.”

With resources allocated, the battle continued in earnest. The overall plan called for an attempt to divert Muck away from the Third Fleet while also being in the range of Mars’ guns. A coup de grace with a combined and strengthened armada would end the affair.

But Muck’s inexorable size proved challenging to steer. And despite being interrupted every time it attempted to teleport towards Tov and his people, it still gave chase the old-fashioned way.

All the while, the distance between the beast and its prey grew wider.

Suddenly, Jupiter observed a massive build-up of energy within Muck. Jupiter scowled as he glared at the monster. “What crap are you cooking up this time, you bastard?” He snarled.

The answer came when needle-like spires, similar to those from the dead Urchin, emerged from its massive form.

Jupiter scoffed, allowing the scene to play along.

With a harrowing screech filled with indignation and anger, Muck fired its countless spires into space. However, what they hit were few, and what they did strike were dilapidated corpses and broken pieces.

“Hah!” Jupiter taunted, “Slim pickings, Mucky boy? You won’t find carcasses in the Inner Zone that we haven’t ravaged to oblivion.”

True enough, the Starless corpses that were hit struggled to reanimate, their flesh churning and moving impotently.

“Useless!” Jupiter and Mars spoke in unison, not realising their android shells shouted the word as they accompanied Tov and his people, the aliens jumping in surprise. Jupiter coughed as he hid his embarrassed face while Mars remained unfazed, immersed in the glory.

It wouldn’t be long before the final act began. The chessboard was primed for checkmate, and soon, Eldest will wake up to… Jupiter paused, not wanting to think what the Eldest would do when she found out how things had gone awry.

Jupiter felt a cold shiver down his spine, suddenly feeling too close to Earth.

He shook his head, focusing back on the task at hand.

==========================

The minutes dragged on—each second feeling like an eternity to Jupiter's digital existence. Time moved like molasses as he juggled thousands of tasks a second—communicating with his siblings, monitoring Tov and his people, and overseeing the relentless assault on Muck's decaying form.

Jupiter looked at the battle before him, his mind quickly parsing through the organised chaos. Impatience coursed through him. He wanted to be done with it.

“No wonder the Eldest feels like shit after every battle,” he muttered.

His attention returned to his android shell, faithfully trailing Tov and his allies. Venus and Mars, ever the stalwart companions, worked alongside them, tending to the maddened sailors and detaining those ensnared by Muck's influence.

They were currently within a small and ruined office. Jupiter remained silent as he watched the scene unfold.

“Friend Mars, please, you may put him down,” Tov pleaded in a weary tone.

Holding a mind-controlled sailor by his ankles, Mars glanced between Tov and his captive, a moment of contemplation passing over his face. ""Very well,"" he rumbled, releasing his grip.

The sailor's limp body thudded against the metal floor head first, unconsciousness claiming him instantly. Tov, Mars, Venus, and the others in the room stared blankly at the slumped figure, their expressions devoid of emotion apart from pity and exhaustion.

Tov clicked his mandibles, breaking the awkward silence as he spoke, “That should be the last of them,” he turned toward Jupiter and his siblings, “I thank you again. Your assistance has expedited this process.”

“We are your hosts, friend Tov,” Mars spoke as he inspected a painting on the wall, fixing the skewed frame back into place. “Our mission is to protect you.”

“I know,” Tov responded when frustration seeped out of his voice. “Yet, all my people and I have done is run.”

“Don’t beat yourselves up for it, Tov,” Venus chimed, her voice comforting as she placed her hands on her chest. “You faced a Leviathan and lived! I heard the wider galaxy call Muck’s kind as civilisation enders and myths of horror.”

Tov remained silent, looking toward the monitor that followed their group and observing the raging war.

He sighed, slowly shaking his antennae as he replied, “We do not wish to rely on you always, generous and brave hosts you have been.”

Jupiter chose that moment to speak, instantly taking control of his android body, “I get you, Tov. You don’t like being the bystander. You want a chance to give the hurt instead of taking it.”

Tov nodded, fire igniting his voice, “We do. I remember it all, even after a century. The horrors and pain the Starless left, the pieces we had to pick up. The end of the Cataclysm was a moment of pride, a time when I led a fleet in the counterattack to retake a portion of what was lost.”

Tov gestured to the monitor, “This? It feels like in the early days of that catastrophe. For most, they could do nothing except join the Exodus, cowering and packed into overcrowded starships—screaming in anguish over lost homes and loved ones. Dying in droves, no control over their fates.”

Jupiter listened in respect when Tov paused, lost in his thoughts, before continuing, “All the while, we were in your positions, veterans like myself, Admiral Yan, General Ohnar, and so many more—protecting those who couldn’t protect themselves. The first line of defence, sometimes the last.”

Tov took a deep breath, turning toward an overturned chair; he slowly made his way to it and set it upright before taking a seat. The fury dissipated, leaving behind a weary soldier, “Sometimes we failed.”

Tov gazed deeply into Jupiter, Mars and Venus’ eyes. “You have no idea how many you have saved.”

Everyone in the room solemnly remained quiet. The marines of the Third Fleet and Tov’s Honour Guards took a knee and bowed their heads toward the androids. Jupiter, Mars and Luna stood frozen, not knowing what to say.

Eventually, Jupiter shook his head, “The humans and androids of Sol fought first. The Eldest came next. And it was a decade when Luna fragmented from her mind, followed by the rest of us. Cataclysm should have ended long before we Sub AIs existed.”

“We don’t deserve your thanks, Tov,” Jupiter spoke with a sad smile.

“But you do,” Tov whispered, “Aren’t you all still fighting?”

Jupiter lowered his eyes, staring at the ground. “What else is there to do?”

A rare look of sorrow marked Venus’ face, her dainty fingers covering her mouth.

Mars remained stoic, although his eyes hid his contemplation. He looked to the sprawled-out bodies of the unconscious afflicted before turning towards his siblings, his hands clasped behind his back.

“The right thing,” Mars spoke softly. “There is valour in what we do, yes? And knowing what we do now, I feel…""

Jupiter looked toward Mars with rapt attention as the red giant paused, mulling over his words. After a moment of silence, Mars continued, ""Purpose.""

Mars strode toward Tov, footsteps quaking the room. He spoke in a booming, determined voice when he stood before the Patriarch, towering over the Kurskann. “We will continue fighting. Muck will die today. Then, the rest.""

In a calm motion, Mars raised his massive arm. ""We would be honoured to have you by our side,” he offered his hand, one large enough to grasp Tov’s head. “Comrades?”

Tov stared at the outstretched hand, his eyes reflecting a mix of emotions—determination, weariness, and a glimmer of hope.

Slowly, Tov reached out and clasped Mars' hand in his own. ""Comrades,"" he whispered.

&gt; The ongoing debt ceiling crisis can be explained in three words: Marjorie Taylor Greene.

&gt; Raising the debt ceiling has never been a big deal when there&amp;#039;s a Republican in the White House.

&gt; The debt ceiling allows the country to pay debts it has already incurred.

&gt; The Republican House Speaker McCarthy is fully in the pocket of Big MAGA. Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is a wholly owned subsidiary of Greene and the House&amp;#039;s collection of destructive MAGA lawmakers, politicians whose every decision is driven by the questions &amp;quot;Will this make me look cool on Fox News?&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Will this make former President Donald Trump love me more?&amp;quot; So rather than attempt to be reasonable or concerned about the nation&amp;#039;s economy, the speaker is all-in on demanding that President Joe Biden make massive budgetary concessions in exchange for McCarthy and his merry band of bunglers doing quite literally the bare minimum - not tanking the U.S. economy.

&gt; Last week the GOP-led House passed a debt-ceiling bill called the &amp;quot;Limit, Save, Grow Act.&amp;quot; It raises the debt ceiling, but only if there are $4.5 trillion in cuts to government programs, including a number of Biden initiatives on climate change, student loans and funding the IRS to help run down tax cheats.

&gt; As Biden has made clear, and as Jean Pierre repeated Tuesday: &amp;quot;He is not going to negotiate on the debt ceiling.&amp;quot; But the president is &amp;quot;Willing to have a separate conversation on the budget.""

Some people might know who I am.  Some might not.  But today I kinda wanted to put an idea in everyone's head to chew on and mull over.  But first, I need to take you into a certain hobby I play.

It's called Dungeons and Dragons.  Popular game by a company called Wizards of the Coast that has ties to magic, dragons, and all sorts of races.  The reason for this is that the races can make the game interesting to run when you have variety and diversity.  One of those constants is the setting called [Mystara](https://dungeonsdragons.fandom.com/wiki/Mystara) which has various different factions.  Sure, you can play as a wood elf in other settings (or [Drow in Forgotten Realms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPEG27RJYCk)), but Mystara has the Shadow Elves.  Their history and what they do adds a LOT of flavor to a campaign.

So why am I talking DnD if we're supposed to be talking about politics?

Because in a sense, this is proving my point.  Factions exist.  Within this DnD discussion, I've talked about THREE different types of elves for the tabletop to which you can begin to describe even more whether it's [The One Ring](https://freeleaguepublishing.com/en/games/the-one-ring/) and Lord of the Ring's Elves or some other fantasy setting influenced by them.  Diversity of elves naturally exists if you're good at what you do.  But again...  To reiterate:

**Factions Exist**

Different people, with different experiences, link up to achieve a goal.  They have different skills and different ways to succeed.  But people come together to get through an ordeal they couldn't possibly do by themselves.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

So let's drop the topic and point to the key word.  Factions.  People find groups that have similar ideas outside their own experience.  On Way of the Bern, I find [staying at the airport](https://old.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/yre8vz/welcome_to_way_of_the_bern_airlines/) tends to see me following a traveler or two as they fly in or out or [just asking a question of the other travelers](https://old.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/ymv3rw/wotb_regulars_what_have_you_learned_from_this_sub/) and seeing what others have to say.  Usually, you find out commonality and see what others have to say which can help guide your empathy.

People arrive here from very different circumstances to find a lot of things here.  For the [troll bys](https://old.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/twwdha/just_gotta_love_it_second_and_possibly_also_last/) it's a new place to land.  For conservatives, they usually find [Synthetic Left](https://old.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/12sq3xw/amazing_priorities_from_the_synthetic_left/) folks being trashed.

For people that consider themselves socialists, they usually find [new smears to dismantle](https://old.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/11312yz/when_you_want_to_build_a_moment_theres_always_a/) and [shitlibs to dismantle](https://old.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/134kmut/the_growth_of_the_synthetic_left_was_the_death_of/)

And what's the new way to understand the world?  Factions, right?  Well, what's the faction that we're facing?  If there's factions for the people at the bottom...

Then what's the factions at the top?  That's divisions of the ruling class.  Rockefellers...  Rothchilds...  Business interests...  [The ruling class is made of factions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4-STw7jfsE) as explained by Carl Oglesby in the Yankee and Cowboy War (there's a [book](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/2072443) too).

Factions have interests.  They have what they're fighting for and their own alignments similar to Dnd.  For example... [Why learn about Robert Mercer?](https://old.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/a8wuj1/billionaire_donor_robert_mercer_cuts_back_on_gop/)  His alignments for Trump were influential.  How about the Rothschilds and Rockefellers?  Where do their interests lie?  If you look into the funding of [Planned Parenthood](https://www.rbf.org/about/our-history/timeline/planned-parenthood) you see the Rockefellers fund it.  Why the interest?  Because their alignment with [eugenics](https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-forgotten-lessons-of-the-american-eugenics-movement) is of note to their history.

&gt;A sloppy reading of Gregor Mendel’s pea pods and Charles Darwin’s theories gave a scientific veneer to the conclusion that many social ills were caused by the proliferation of the wrong sort of people and that they could be neatly nipped in the bud with the intervention of eugenics—a term coined, in 1883, by Darwin’s half-cousin Francis Galton, who declared it “a virile creed, full of hopefulness.” Soon, the United States, along with Germany, was at the forefront of the movement to improve the human species through breeding. Scientific American ran articles on the subject, and the American Museum of Natural History hosted conferences. Theodore Roosevelt, Alexander Graham Bell, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., and many other prominent citizens were outspoken supporters. Eugenics was taught in schools, celebrated in exhibits at the World’s Fair, and even preached from pulpits. The human race, one prominent advocate declared in 1909, was poised “to dry up the springs that feed the torrent of defective and degenerate protoplasm.”

Even FDR was a eugenicist but is important.  He was funded by elites but they [formed a Business Plot](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/coup-jan6-fdr-new-deal-business-plot-1276709/) against him.

This... Was a division in the ruling class.  Different factions, have different aims and goals.

Currently, this is just a teaser at what's going on.  If you can have different elves in fantasy, why can't there be different factions in reality of people pushing for different aims and goals?

As divisions in the ruling class continue, they have to gain power through the working class below.  So different factions exist within the population that are encouraged or crushed based on those battles.  Trump gained power with low level capitalists, not the ultra elite.  But working class conservatives found their champion.

For others such as Tulsi Gabbard, she finds power through the Pentagon who are in a long divisive faction battle with the CIA, who has a LOT of members in the Democratic Party.

But this is just an appetizer.  A way to make people consider a different way of viewing the world.

More will come when you have to get into the historical context of this view.  See ya'll then.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/136kxz4/faction_battles_forward/,3,5,0,self.WayOfTheBern,Inuma

This week, we move on to special elections in Pennsylvania! Updated 5-3-23","Yesterday was a good day for local elections.  A township clerk in Michigan, who was an election denier, lost her recall election in a Trump +52 township, the mayorship of Easton, Maryland, flipped, in the process defeating a 20 year republican incumbent, and democrats held the Lincoln, Nebraska, mayorship and city council!  

This month is a busy one for elections!  In Pennsylvania, we have primaries for local elections and statewide judicial elections, as well as two special elections that will determine if we keep the majority in the State House!

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00HY797k9yc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00HY797k9yc)

Note that he's talking about the idea of truly intelligent AGI's, maybe ASI's in the interview, not the ones we have today.

Unfortunately the interview is in turkish, if you're interested I can try translate the whole interview for you, although I might not do a great job at it. But here's the relevant part (starting at 8:30):

&amp;#x200B;

Interviewer: ""If artificial intelligence is gonna be an objective intelligence, wouldn't it determine that the species causing the most harm to the world are humans and thus would try to eliminate humans?""

Şengör: ""It could try to eliminate humans, or it could try to educate humans. Humans might turn to educate themselves. The AI could say 'if you continue like that we'll be on bad terms', and then you'd be afraid. Right? When today someone would stand up and say they're leaving the paris agreement the AI could say 'Oh is that so? Then I may get rid of you so we'd be better off, and the atmosphere could take a breath', as an example. So the AI could in also show us the right path.

Now, you could say if the AI is silicone based, it might not feel the need to help carbon based life forms. Yes correct, that's a possibility. But wait a minute there, are you suggesting we could stop evolution? You can't dear friend, don't get your hopes up. Your mind's not enough for that. This is part of evolution. It may happen, or it may not happen. Maybe we'll move from being carbon based to silicon based ourselves, maybe. We can already see examples of transitions, replacing various body parts. Right? Slowly we'll move onto living more comfortable and securer lives. It's not possible to hinder this, let's just understand that first. Therefore, we should try to use it as best as we can. And the only way to do so is critical education. Critical thinking. Those who can't will be left behind. Look, that's guaranteed. There's no if. You often see Prof. Doğan write that those who can't adapt will become slaves. They won't even be able to become slaves there will be no need for slaves.""

&amp;#x200B;

And here's another closely related part from the interview (7:02):

Interviewer: ""On this topic, we say that humanity's only weapon is his intelligence. And there is a growing crowd saying this will be the downfall of humanity.""

Şengör: ""Now, how do they know that? There is no such thing. We don't know. Let me repeat again, we don't know. Intelligence can't be humanity's end. The lack of it could be. Right? When Donald Trump or Kim throw 2 atom bombs around then we'll see the results. Because that's a lack of intelligence. Intelligence exists to hinder such acts. Therefore, we mustn't fear intelligence. Intelligence exists to solve problems. That's why evolution had to create intelligence, to solve problems. We couldn't survive otherwise. We musn't fear a tool that solves problems.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/136kbkb/found_this_5_year_old_hidden_gem_from_prof_dr/,8,0,0,self.singularity,Bakagami-

# Gameplay and Features of Call Break

A normal 52-card deck is used to play the trick-taking game of Call Break. The goal of the game is to win as many tricks as you can by playing the highest card in each round. Each player is dealt 13 cards. Each participant makes a ""call"" or a wager at the start of the game on the number of tricks they think they can win. Each round's number of cards dealt equals the total number of tricks that players can bet on.

The highest bidder leads the first trick after the bidding round, and the game then officially starts. The remaining players then alternately play a card from their hands, trying to imitate the previous player's action. 

In Call Break, not all suits are created equal, and this is the big twist in the game. One of the four suits is designated as the ""trump"" suit for each round, which implies that any card from that suit, regardless of its rank, is higher than any other card dealt. The game continues until all 13 tricks have been played with the player who wins the previous trick using a trump card leading the subsequent trick.

Call Break also has a number of features that add to the game's enjoyment and engagement. Players can alter the game's appearance and feel by selecting from a variety of themes and card designs. Additionally, there are other game modes available, including Classic and Solo games, which offer various gameplay experiences. Additionally, during the game, participants can speak with one another, giving the game a social component.

There's nothing in it for him.  The downsides are easy to see and Perticone goes over them.  He'd just be letting his opponents steal some of his spotlight.  He might get boxed in on something like Covid\*, etc.  The upside is miniscule.  

But this calculation reveals the modern GOP in much the same way as the calculation that the main reason to not like Trump is that he might have trouble winning the general election.

The reason candidates attend debates is because they're supposed to, just like they're supposed to release their tax records (if they get that far).  The debates aren't for the candidates, they're for the country, and this is just another example of the rampant norm-shattering that Republicans are engaged in to their (short term) benefit, but the country's (long term) detriment.

When Trump says what's in it for me it betrays his lack of civic temperament, and when the party goes along with him it does the same.  Neither they nor he are worthy in any way of any office in this nation.

Sure, I remember the hugeness of ZooTv with amazement.  I loved the Vertigo tour. And the JT25 tour was so nostalgic and wonderful.  I+E less so, even if it was a technical masterpiece. But I've been strangely surprised at just how GREAT PopMart was.  And so weirdly - it comes across as LESS dated than some of the others. I mean, ZooTV was incredible, but who would want to see Bono calling up Trump like he did Bush these days?  The world has changed, for the worse, and PopMart saw it before it even happened. 

I saw the tour 6 times and at the time, thought it was too gimmicky and too strange to hold up long term, but the set list is perfect, the stage and screens are incredible, and everything was absolutely perfect.  Even though I would never rank Pop at the top of their albums, the songs off it are good, and the other stuff (including the mirrorball lemon) somehow feel right. I wasn't expecting to love it as much as I did, and yet, here I am, writing on Reddit about it.  (Staring at the Sun still sounds like crap though, so there's that)

Obviously just my opinion - but this is the perfect show.  God I hope they come back to Argentina sometime.  I'd pay Sphere prices for that show.",https://www.reddit.com/r/U2Band/comments/136g8vi/popmart_tour_was_their_best/,15,5,0,self.U2Band,JJKEISER

Apocalypse!Taylor rating for anyone who doesn't know 

Changer/Trump: Apocalypse is able to manipulate his own molecular structure down to the atomic level, because of this he can give himself a limited form of most powers, ie he can have super strength but he can't out muscle the hulk

Changer/Tinker: do to celestial* tech Apocalypse can control most technology and this also boosts his first ability above letting him copy technology as well, do to this he's able to make a convincing copy of most powers that don't break the laws of physics (ie he can't warp reality but can make illusion's)

Trump/Breaker: after enough time has passed Apocalypses body starts to breakdown and die, Apocalypse can forcefully possess someone and steal their body to live and also gains that person's power's while in them, this can be fought of and resisted if the person is more powerful or has sufficient will but even if Apocalypse dies he simply remains as a ghost until he gains a proper host**

Trump/Striker: Apocalypse can take four ""horsemen"" and increase the strength of their powers sometimes even adding new features though this has shown to need physical touch along with either consent or can be forced with a Master effect but seems to leave the horsemen weaker then if they were willing 

* for the purposes of this idea it's just standard tinker tech that Taylor knows how to make 

** note that if the potential host body isn't strong or healthy enough to handle Apocalypses power and he full takes over they explode

An inside account","&gt;My name is Andrew Lowenthal. I am a progressive-minded Australian who for almost 18 years was the Executive Director of EngageMedia, an Asia-based NGO focused on human rights online, freedom of expression, and open technology. My resume also includes fellowships at Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center and MIT’s Open Documentary Lab. 

---

&gt;For most of my career, I believed strongly in the work I was doing, which I believed was about protecting and expanding digital rights and freedoms. 

&gt;In recent years, however, I watched in despair as a dramatic change swept through my field. As if all at once, organizations and colleagues with whom I’d worked for years began ***de-emphasizing freedom of speech and expression, and shifted focus to a new arena: fighting “disinformation.”***

---

&gt;For EngageMedia team members in Myanmar, Indonesia, India, or the Philippines, the new elite Western consensus of ***giving governments greater power to decide what could be said online was the opposite of the work we were doing.***

----

&gt;When Malaysian and Singaporean governments introduced “fake news” laws, EngageMedia supported networks of activists campaigning against it. 

&gt;We ran digital security workshops for journalists and human rights advocates under threat from government attack, both virtual and physical. 

----

&gt;We developed an independent video platform to route around Big Tech censorship and supported campaigners in Thailand fighting government attempts to suppress free expression. 

----

&gt;In Asia, government interference in speech and expression was the norm. Progressive activists in search of more political freedom often looked to the West for moral and financial support. 

&gt;Now the West is turning against the core value of free expression, in the name of fighting disinformation.

------

&gt;I’d been swimming in the broader digital rights field for two decades and saw the rapid growth of anti-disinformation initiatives up close. I knew many of the key organizations and their leaders, and EngageMedia had itself been part of anti-disinformation projects.

----

&gt;After gaining access to #TwitterFiles records, I learned the ecosystem was far bigger and had much more influence than I imagined. As of now we’ve compiled close to ***400 organisations globally, and we are just getting started. Some organisations are legitimate.*** There is disinformation. But there are a great many wolves among the sheep.

---

&gt;I underestimated just how much money is being pumped into ***think tanks, academia and NGOs under the anti-disinformation front, both from the government and private philanthropy.***

&gt;We’re still calculating, but I had estimated it at hundreds of millions of dollars annually and I’m probably still being naive - Peraton received a USD $1B dollar contract from the Pentagon. 

---

&gt;In particular, I was unaware of the scope and scale of the work of groups like the ***Atlantic Council, the Aspen Institute, the Center for European Policy Analysis and consultancies such as Public Good Projects, Newsguard, Graphika, Clemson’s Media Forensics Hub and others.***

----

&gt;Even more alarming was just how much military and intelligence funding is involved, how closely aligned the groups are, how much they mix in civil society. 

---

&gt;Graphika for example ***received a $3M Department of Defense grant, as well as funds from the US Navy and Air Force.*** 

&gt;The Atlantic Council (of Digital Forensics Lab infamy) receives funds from ***the US Army and Navy, Blackstone, Raytheon, Lockheed, the NATO STRATCOM Center of Excellence, and more.*** 

----

&gt;Twitter emails show consistent collaboration between military and intelligence officials and elite “progressives” from NGOs and academia...

&gt;How did the FBI and the Pentagon, once the avowed enemies of progressives for their attacks on the Black Panthers and the peace movement, their war-mongering and gross over-funding, begin to fuse and collude? 

----

&gt;They join together in election tabletop exercises and share hors d’oeuvres at conferences put on by oligarch philanthropists. That cultural and political shift was once a heavy lift, but now it is as simple as cc’ing each other.

---

&gt;In 2022, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken featured prominently at RightsCon, the digital rights field’s biggest conference (an event EngageMedia co-organised in 2015 in the Philippines — Blinken did not appear then). 

&gt;Blinken oversees the Global Engagement Center (GEC), one of the most important US Government anti-disinformation initiatives...and is now alleged to have initiated his own disinformation campaign related to the Hunter Biden laptop - that of the “Russian information operation” letter signed by 50 former US intelligence officials.

---

&gt;Once adversaries are brought together via a strong through-line tracing ***from counter-terrorism, to countering violent extremism, to Minority Report-style policing of everyday speech and political difference***.

---

&gt;Stanford’s Virality Project recommended that Twitter ***classify “true stories of vaccine side effects” as “standard misinformation on your platform,”*** while the Algorithmic Transparency Institute spoke of “civic listening” and “automated collection of data” from “closed messaging apps” in order to ***combat “problematic content”, i.e. spying on everyday citizens.*** 

---

&gt;In some cases the problem was in the title of the NGO itself - Automated Controversy Monitoring for instance does “toxicity monitoring” to combat “unwanted content that triggers you.” ***Nothing about truth or untruth, it’s all narrative control.***

----

&gt;Government and philanthropic oligarchs have colonized civil society and proxied this censorship through think-tanks, academia, and NGOs. Tell this to the sector, however, and they close ranks around their government, military, intelligence, Big Tech, and billionaire patrons. 

&gt;The field has been bought. It is compromised. Pointing that out is not welcome. Do so, and into the “basket of deplorables” for you.

---

&gt;In days gone by the digital rights field would have ***paid close attention to the #TwitterFiles, as we did with the Wikileaks or Snowden revelations. Much of the same field that once lauded Wikileaks and Snowden are now the ones who have become compromised.*** 

&gt;The Files make plain egregious acts of censorship were ***enabled or ignored by NGOs and academia, often not because they were wrong, but because the ideas came from the wrong people.***

----

&gt;Trump and Brexit are often cited as the turning point, a great political realignment that saw cultural elites shift to the left, and the working class move to the right. 

&gt;The NGO and academic class (elites despite their internal narratives) reacted by ***aligning their causes ever more tightly with corporate and government power, and vice-versa***.

---

&gt;Brexit and Trump seriously dented the authority and status of the expert/professional managerial class. These events were explained away as being the result of bad actors (racists, misogynists, Russians), stupidity, or “misinformation.” The usual leftist class/materialist analysis was thrown out for a simple story of good and evil.

----

&gt;COVID-19 made things weirder. Big Media and Big Tech fell completely out of sync with material reality, ***smearing criticism that had previously been normal, and explicitly banning topics from social media such as discussion of a possible lab leak, or vaccines not stopping viral transmission.*** 

&gt;Polite society agreed with such bans, stayed silent, or even, as in the case of the Virality Project and its partners, led the censoring.

---

&gt;A cadre of ***North American and European anti-disinformation elites meanwhile had been slowly convincing NGOs in Asia, Africa, and Latin America that their biggest problem was not too little but too much online freedom***, the solution to which was ***more corporate and government control in order to protect human rights and democracy.***

&gt;Given that almost all the funding for such civil society initiatives comes from the US and Europe, ***those in the rest of the world had the option of losing funding or following suit.*** So 
much for “decolonizing” philanthropy.	

---

&gt;...Top down direction and conformity crept in, post-Trump, and exploded during COVID-19. There was no doubt in my mind that failure to conform to official pandemic narratives would see you defunded. At EngageMedia, we tried to sound the alarm about the new authoritarianism in our Pandemic of Control series, writing:

&gt;&gt;*The “approved” pandemic response was defended at all costs. News media ridiculed alternative viewpoints as fake news and misinformation, and social media platforms took down contradictory views from their feeds, silencing voices that questioned vaccine passports, lockdowns, and other controls.*

&gt;&gt;*And while restrictions continue to be eased in most countries, in others they are not. In addition, much of the infrastructure remains at the ready, and the population itself is now well-groomed for the new sets of demands, from digital IDs to central bank digital currencies and beyond.*

---

&gt;Such concern about rights and overreach was unfortunately rare in the field. Control of funds under a ***philanthropic sector operating largely in lock-step with government accounts for much of the increasing conformity in the sector.*** 

&gt;More concerning, however, is that many, if not ***most of the educated activists and intellectuals in these organizations agree with the recent turn against freedom of expression.***

----

&gt;Writing this, I’m reminded of a media literacy/disinformation event I attended in 2021 at an Australian university – a participant bemoaned that ***the cause of our ills was too much free speech; all four panelists, one after the other, agreed.*** 

&gt;All the money aside, many elite hearts and minds have already been won.

----

&gt;By legitimizing wide-ranging government intervention in the speech of everyday citizens, the anti-disinformation field and its ideological allies including Canada’s Justin Trudeau, America’s Joe Biden, and former New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, have ***given authoritarian regimes much greater license to do the same to their own citizens***

----

&gt;Disinformation does of course exist and does need to be addressed. However, the ***biggest source of disinformation are governments, corporations and increasingly anti-disinformation experts themselves***, who have through COVID-19 and many other issues gotten the facts wrong.

----

&gt;Weaponizing anti-disinformation to censor and smear their opponents is resulting in exactly what the expert class feared: diminished trust in authority. 

&gt;The moral depravity of the Virality Project protecting BigPharma by ***advocating for the censorship of true vaccine side effects is beyond astounding.*** 

&gt;Imagine doing this for a car company whose airbags were unsafe, because it might cause people to stop buying cars.

----

&gt;...Over the past century the primary advocates of free speech have been liberals and progressives like myself, who frequently defended the rights of people whose values they sometimes differed from and were highly unpopular with mainstream American society at the time, such as the over-policing of the Muslim community during the War on Terror.

---

&gt;While progressives might believe they are in charge, I think it’s much more the case that we are being used. Under the cover of social justice, the corporate machine rolls on. 

&gt;The US government and its allies, realizing that information was the future of conflict, slowly but surely ***engineered a takeover of the independent, adversarial organisations that should be holding them to account.***

----

&gt;...The elites grab the ideas that serve their purposes, hollow them out, and get to work. Wealth inequality became much worse under COVID-19, even as the halls of power became more diverse. “Progressives” hardly said a word.

&gt;The cultural shift is only partly organic. The Virality Project shows how ***powerful people cynically harnessed well-intentioned ideas about protecting people’s health, when in reality, they were protecting and advancing the interests of Big Pharma and expanding the infrastructure for future information control projects***.

----

&gt;In February 2021 I met with a leading anti-disinformation organization, FirstDraft — now ***called the Information Futures Lab at Brown University*** — to discuss collaborating. 

&gt;The meeting became awkward when they claimed the Philippine #Kickvax campaign was anti-vaccination. Nearly half of EngageMedia’s staff and most of the leadership team were Filipino. 

&gt;The campaign had come up in conversations with them, so I knew it was actually ***an anti-corruption drive focusing on the Chinese vaccine, hence the name: SinoVac + kick backs = #Kickvax.***

---

&gt;The campaign was making serious allegations regarding the SinoVac procurement process. 

&gt;In 2021 Transparency International ranked the Philippines 117th for corruption out of 180 countries surveyed. Left-wing activism in the Philippines has long taken aim at corruption among elites.

---

&gt;Despite this, FirstDraft staff told me very firmly again that #Kickvax was spreading anti-vaccine misinformation. 

&gt;I was given an “are you from outer-space and/or a potential menace?” -type look before the meeting wrapped up. No collaborations were pursued. 

---

&gt;From the #TwitterFiles I’ve since seen just how deeply involved FirstDraft were in trying to squash valid questions around the vaccine. 

&gt;It was a core focus. ***FirstDraft were also part of the Trusted News Initiative, a kind of Virality Project for the legacy media.*** 

&gt;The Information Futures Lab runs a project to “increase vaccine demand”. Co-founder Stefanie Friedhoff is also part of the White House COVID-19 Response Team.

----

&gt;Western oligarchs too ***fund a huge amount of censorship work and wield far too much power over politics and civil society.*** 

&gt;Changing how tax breaks work for philanthropy is also needed. 

&gt;It’s not that all such money is to be removed, but it should be a supplement, not the main course.

----

&gt;Civil society needs to ***stop cozying up to Big Tech and taking huge amounts of its money***. This too has resulted in capture and the ***faltering of proper watchdog roles.***

----

&gt;Clearer boundaries need to be drawn. I’m not generally for deplatforming, but anyone ***taking military, defense contractor, or intelligence agency money should not be part of civil society and human rights events.*** 

---

&gt;That includes the Atlantic Council (including DRFlabs), Graphika, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, the Center for European Policy Analysis and many others — the list is long. As the database of “anti-disinformation” groups and their funders develops there will be more to add.

----

&gt;More ***decentralized, open-source and secure platforms are needed to resist corporate, philanthropic, and government capture.*** 

&gt;There are only so many people with $44 billion dollars on hand. The challenge is generating the wide audiences that drive so many users to large platforms...

----

&gt;The even bigger problem is a ***culture that supports widespread censorship, particularly among its previous guardians, progressives, liberals and the left.*** 

&gt;Free speech has become ***a dirty word for the very people who once led the free speech movement.*** 

&gt;Changing that is a long-term project that requires demonstrating how ***free speech is primarily there to protect the powerless, not the powerful.*** 

---

&gt;Most important is to ***return to strong principles of free expression, including for ideas we dislike***. The shoe will one day again be on the other foot. 

&gt;When that day comes ***free speech will not be the enemy of liberals and progressives, it will be the best possible protection against the abuse of power.***

&gt; WASHINGTON - U.S. and Mexican officials have agreed on new immigration policies meant to deter illegal border crossings while also opening up other pathways ahead of an expected increase in migrants following the end of pandemic restrictions next week.

&gt; Despite sharing a 1,951-mile border with the U.S., Mexico had been notably absent from the rollout last week of a fresh set of efforts, including the creation of hubs outside the United States where migrants could go to apply to legally settle in the U.S., Spain or Canada.

&gt; With Mexico now behind the U.S., plus an announcement Tuesday that 1,500 active-duty U.S. troops are deploying south for administrative support, and other crackdown measures in place, border officials believe they may be able to manage overcrowding and other possible issues that might arise once the COVID-19 restrictions end.

&gt; Mexico said Tuesday it would continue to accept up to 30,000 migrants per month from the four countries that are making up a ballooning share of the overall illegal border crossings, with no easy way to quickly return migrants to their home countries.

&gt; Then-President Trump deployed active-duty troops to the border to assist border patrol personnel in processing large migrant caravans, on top of National Guard forces that were already working in that capacity.

&gt; As a condition for Austin&amp;#039;s previous approval of National Guard troops to the border through Oct. 1, Homeland Security had to agree to work with the White House and Congress to develop a plan for longer-term staffing solutions and funding shortfalls to maintain security and immigration processing without the use of Defense Department resources, Pentagon officials said.

&gt;In 2021 Transparency International ranked the Philippines 117th for corruption out of 180 countries surveyed. Left-wing activism in the Philippines has long taken aim at corruption among elites.

---

&gt;Despite this, FirstDraft staff told me very firmly again that #Kickvax was spreading anti-vaccine misinformation. 

&gt;I was given an “are you from outer-space and/or a potential menace?” -type look before the meeting wrapped up. No collaborations were pursued. 

---

&gt;From the #TwitterFiles I’ve since seen just how deeply involved FirstDraft were in trying to squash valid questions around the vaccine. 

&gt;It was a core focus. ***FirstDraft were also part of the Trusted News Initiative, a kind of Virality Project for the legacy media.*** 

&gt;The Information Futures Lab runs a project to “increase vaccine demand”. Co-founder Stefanie Friedhoff is also part of the White House COVID-19 Response Team.

----

&gt;Western oligarchs too ***fund a huge amount of censorship work and wield far too much power over politics and civil society.*** 

&gt;Changing how tax breaks work for philanthropy is also needed. 

&gt;It’s not that all such money is to be removed, but it should be a supplement, not the main course.

----

&gt;Civil society needs to ***stop cozying up to Big Tech and taking huge amounts of its money***. This too has resulted in capture and the ***faltering of proper watchdog roles.***

----

&gt;Clearer boundaries need to be drawn. I’m not generally for deplatforming, but anyone ***taking military, defense contractor, or intelligence agency money should not be part of civil society and human rights events.*** 

---

&gt;That includes the Atlantic Council (including DRFlabs), Graphika, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, the Center for European Policy Analysis and many others — the list is long. As the database of “anti-disinformation” groups and their funders develops there will be more to add.

----

&gt;More ***decentralized, open-source and secure platforms are needed to resist corporate, philanthropic, and government capture.*** 

&gt;There are only so many people with $44 billion dollars on hand. The challenge is generating the wide audiences that drive so many users to large platforms...

----

&gt;The even bigger problem is a ***culture that supports widespread censorship, particularly among its previous guardians, progressives, liberals and the left.*** 

&gt;Free speech has become ***a dirty word for the very people who once led the free speech movement.*** 

&gt;Changing that is a long-term project that requires demonstrating how ***free speech is primarily there to protect the powerless, not the powerful.*** 

---

&gt;Most important is to ***return to strong principles of free expression, including for ideas we dislike***. The shoe will one day again be on the other foot. 

&gt;When that day comes ***free speech will not be the enemy of liberals and progressives, it will be the best possible protection against the abuse of power.***

Hvis de sier du er heks så er du heks, og veien til bålet er kort.

I Norge har vi samme ordning. Når de mektige sier du står i leddtog med onde makter så gjør du det.

Bevis trengs ikke. De aktiverer bare et korps lydige redaksjoner som forvandler beskyldninger til bevis på kommando.

I 2019 ble det ekstra ille. En korrupsjonsjeger hadde avslørt for mange mektige folk:

https://np.reddit.com/r/Nrk/comments/136cvcf/korrupsjonsjegeren/

Da er det ingen nåde. De korrupte vil alltid ta korrupsjonsjegere, sånn har det alltid vært, og over hele Europa lystret redaksjonene og repeterte det samme budskapet: ""Han tjener onde makter""

I Norge var det Harald Stanghelle som tok jobben: 

https://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/kommentar/i/RRKOyA/helten-som-ble-demokratiets-fiende-harald-stanghelle

Bilde av tekst: https://i.redd.it/0g470elfulxa1.png

Teksten er full av kraftige påstander.

&gt;Assanges [tok] avgjørelsen om å gå russernes ærend

&gt;Assange stilte Wikileaks til disposisjon for en russisk kampanje

&gt;Assange ble et viktig ledd i en fremmed makts strategi

&gt;Assange er en fiende av demokratiet


Det er harde anklager, som mangler 2 viktige ting: 

* bevis

* kildekritikk


Stanghelle oppgir Mueller-rapporten som kilde.

Her er den: https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download

450 sider. Det viktigste står i kapittel III og V(b).
 
De som har tid og lyst bør saumfare dokumentet. 
De vil finne lange remser med påstander, blandet med svarte firkanter av sensurert tekst. 

Ikke fnugg av bevis. Heller ikke noe som til nød kan kalles ""dokumentasjon""

Mueller innrømmer selv han ikke vet hvordan WikiLeaks fikk informasjonen, elektronisk eller fysisk på minnepinner:

&gt;The [investigating] Office cannot rule out that stolen documents were transferred to WikiLeaks through intermediaries who visited during the summer of 2016.

Hvis Stanghelle en vakker dag blir spurt om å bevise påstandene sine må han bare vifte klovnaktig med hendene.

Han har ingenting.

Det eneste han har er en instruks og en logrende iver etter å tjene makt. 

Han mestrer heller ikke konseptet Kildekritikk

Har de samme kildene solgt oss tunge løgner før?
 
Har amerikanske sikkerhetsmyndigheter bløffet høyt og heftig de siste 20 årene?

ikke minst med dette historiske skrivet: https://irp.fas.org/cia/product/Iraq_Oct_2002.pdf

som er løgn fra første bokstav til siste punktum.

Det alene ville gitt seriøse journalister grunn til sunn skepsis og kritisk avstand til materialet.

Hvis Stanghelle var journalist ville han ha skrevet: 

&gt;""Assange gikk russernes ærend,"" hevder amerikanske sikkerhetsmyndigheter, som har skrønet om utallige ting de siste 20 årene, uten å legge fram bevis. 

Men Stanghelle har ikke noe imot å selge historier fra notoriske løgnere.

Han gjør jobben sin. 

--

Et positivt resultat av Mueller-rapporten var tiltalen som fulgte.

https://www.justice.gov/file/1080281/download

I en rettssak ville bevisene nødvendigvis komme på bordet, så det lovet godt.
Problemet var at de russiske tiltalte neppe ville stille for en amerikansk domstol, så håpet om å få se bevisene lå fortsatt nær null.

Men så kom en stor overraskelse. 

Et tiltalt russisk selskap (Concord Consulting) stilte faktisk opp i DC.
De lovet kamp og ville forsvare seg mot anklagene i en amerikansk rettssal.

Utrolig positivt for alle oss som ventet på bevisene. 
En rettssak ville tvinge bevisene fram i dagen, og da var ventetiden endelig over.

Vi så fram til det, helt til mars 2020:

https://apnews.com/article/7527e051bd8c4be1beef9d7c37c8290e 

Da trakk amerikanske myndigheter alle anklagene. 

De ville ikke ha rettssak. 

De ville ikke vise bevisene vi hadde ventet på i 4 år.

Nå har vi ventet i 7 år, men bevisene forblir like hemmelige som i 2016.

--

En enkel huskeregel for ekte journalister: Hemmelig bevis er ikke bevis

En konspirasjonsteori er enda mindre bevis.

Den tid er forbi, men ikke i Norge. 

Her kan udokumenterte påstander forvandles til vedtatte sannheter uten andre argumenter enn ""amerikanske tjenestemenn sier det.""

Det er lite vi kan gjøre med et så inngrodd system som det norske.

Det eneste vi kan gjøre er å ikke forveksle virvelløse svampdyr som Stanghelle med ekte journalister.

---------------------------------------

Min mening: 

Jeg vet like lite som Stanghelle om hvor Wikileaks fikk epostene fra.

Jeg vet ikke om de kom fra en lekkasje eller hack.

Derfor følger jeg journalist-regel nr.1 og påstår ingenting om hvem som står bak avsløringene.

Det samme gjelder avsløringene om Trump. Like feil å beskylde kinesere for det.

(Den eneste e-tjenesten vi vet spredte desinformasjon i siste presidentvalg er denne gjengen:

   https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/19/hunter-biden-story-russian-disinfo-430276 )


For meg er det viktigste at informasjonen er ekte. Det trumfer alt. 

I 2023 kan Wikileaks fortsatt skilte med en publikasjons-rekke på 100% ekte vare. 

DNC epostene avslørte alvorlig juks i den amerikanske nominasjonsprosessen.

Uansett hvor informasjonen kom fra var det godt for demokratiet, og skar en korrupt svulst ut av systemet.

Hvis russere faktisk sto bak lekkasjen burde det Hvite Hus bukke og takke dem for å informere amerikanske velgere og dermed styrke demokratiet.

---

Til slutt...

Bruken av guccifer2.0 og dcleaks fortjener et eget kapittel.

Begge gjorde alt de kunne for å blande seg med avsløringene fra Wikileaks (kjent som ""running interference""). 

Begge startet virksomheten ETTER 12.juni 2016, da Wikileaks annonserte slipp av eposter:

https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jun/12/wikileaks-to-publish-more-hillary-clinton-emails-julian-assange

Rekkefølgen er viktig å huske på når falske mediene gjør dem til ""partnere"" med wikileaks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nordmenn/comments/136d9xr/lydighet_over_ærlighet/,0,8,0,self.Nordmenn,hobgobbledegook

Granted, he isn’t my favorite character, but his development has been great to watch and it’s evident that his love for Haley is unconditional.

She was so abrupt in her decision to leave and she’s practically settled with the fact that their marriage may be over, which seems so unlike the character I’ve come to know.

I read somewhere that the actress who plays her believes they were trying to write her off at this point in the show and it makes sense.

It’s been hard seeing Nathan spiral episode after episode and the race car accident trumps everything. I’m very eager to see how Naley survive this tremendous setback in the future seasons.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ONETREEHILL/comments/136d2hq/nathans_sa/,8,4,0,self.ONETREEHILL,troublesomety

One one hand, the ATF explicitly stated that the pistol braces were good to go and should not be allowed to reverse statements like that. On the other hand, that was back in 2012, and especially nowadays, the pistol braces are exploiting what frankly was good faith on the ATF's part, and their reversal is likely at the behest of the Biden administration and not their own initiative.

The ATF allowed pistol braces because they didn't want backlash and *""YOU WON'T LET DISABLED VETERANS USE THEIR GUNS!""*, then they said you can shoulder them so that people didn't say *""YOU'RE GOING TO ARREST ME FOR THIS THING TOUCHING MY BODY?!""* - the firearms industry took this and ran with it and exploited the shit out of it. Of course, SBRs should not be regulated in any way shape or form, but I just don't see how this is the fault of the ATF. Not only did they give good grace by allowing this blatant loophole for over **10 years**, they also were at the command of the Biden administration to close it. I don't believe that, if someone like Trump was in office, the ATF would bother with this regulation. They know it makes them look bad, they know not many people will comply, sure it gives them a reason to request more funding but I highly doubt the ATF wants or needs this on their plate at the moment.

They could've just given people the finger and told them to pony up $200, but they knew that wouldn't fly and are doing the free registration - sure it's not out of the kindness of their heart, but it's still a decision they made. They also recently took on **20 more examiners for form4's** and hired an additional team for Form1s. I don't think they're being wholly unreasonable. 

Of course, I'm not rooting for the ATF and ultimately they **are** on the wrong side of history on this. However, I don't know why people are so Pikachu face over the ATF enforcing firearms laws. The ATF did not create the NFA, and if the ATF didn't exist the FBI would be enforcing it. Also, the Biden administration is responsible for this decision.

Should you register? That's wholly up to you. At first I made fun of people who registered, but thinking about it now - a lower receiver is $50. You're basically getting a ""FREE SBR"" (of course, you need to pay for fingerprints which is like $50 unless you want to deal with doing it yourself). ATF is not making you admit to anything, not making you send pictures of your brace, and they're basically saying you can submit as many as you want for registration. You can submit just one or all of your lowers, and reap the benefits (and cons) of SBR ownership, and in this special case *you don't even need to engrave your lower.* I think you'd be dumb not to consider it. 

The patriot in me says ""don't register shit"" but then, if you really want to fuck with the feds, giving them more paperwork and ultimately costing them $200 is pretty good way to do so.

The only good fed is a dead fed, but I think the firearms community should step back and look at this a bit more logically.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Firearms/comments/136p7zx/nuanced_opinion_on_the_atf_pistol_brace_ruling/,0,1,0,self.Firearms,thethugbaker

***To Hunt a Monster***

==========================

While Tov and his forces valiantly fought to contain the madness within the Third Fleet, the Sub AIs of Sol waged a relentless war in the void. Two colossal armadas, one silver and the other obsidian, clashed with the moon-sized Leviathan, Muck.

From afar, the battle tapestry resembled a swarm of killer wasps assailing a towering bear, delivering vicious stings that tore through its flesh.

They kited the beast, taking advantage of their nimbler sizes to duke around catastrophic attacks.

Muck's agonised cries echoed through the silent expanse of space as chunks of biomass were hurled into the void. Death rained upon the abomination as it endured the unyielding assault—cleaving, perforating, and eviscerating its massive form.

“Yeah, you like that, you overgrown heap of trash!?” Jupiter snarled. His eye twitched at the constant eyesore that has tracked its filth upon the sanctity of Sol’s Inner Zone.

Amidst the flurry of data transfers and issued orders, he and his two siblings orchestrated a symphony of coordinated action.

Factories worked tirelessly to churn out ammunition, missiles, and batteries in a relentless supply chain. Agile supply ships darted through the void, ensuring the unyielding barrage continued unabated. Countless supercomputers meticulously calculated vectors and ran simulations, striving for optimal outcomes.

Yet, the elusive nature of the Starless remained a challenge, constantly unveiling unexpected trump cards hidden within their incomprehensible forms—telekinesis, eldritch energy shields, and silent screams that could disrupt targeting systems were but a few.

Jupiter scoffed at such complications, paltry obstacles unable to impede his fury; to a digital intelligence like him, exploiting patterns was as easy as breathing. He, Luna and Mars operated in perfect harmony, providing mutual support and seizing opportunities as they arose.

However, between the three AIs, Mars easily surpassed them in potency as he angled his guns in optimal firing lines, taking advantage of Muck’s enormous size. Although they came in long intervals, their impact completely overshadowed Jupiter and Luna’s contribution.

Apocalypse Cannons continued to roar like cosmic thunder, blotting out the sun with black smoke. Mars’ guns hurled projectiles like meteors into the void. The barrels glowed with fierce heat, scorching the planet’s surface a stark crimson and transforming Olympus Mons into a primordial volcano.

While Mars' android shell interacted with Tov and his allies, his focus remained steadfast on the true battle unfolding in space. His voice reverberated through the Network, infused with the exhilaration of combat.

“POWER!” He bellowed, feeling a collective wince from his counterparts.

Unfazed by their reaction and immersed in the glory of battle as he was, he continued to proclaim, “I AM GRAM, THE SWORD THAT SLAYED FAFNIR!”

“Stop with the LARPing, Mars,” Jupiter pleaded through the Network with a tinge of exasperation. “I sincerely hope to whatever god exists that Tov and his people never hear you right now.”

Mars responded with boisterous laughter as an Apocalypse beam struck Muck's hide, followed by a barrage of missiles exploiting the opening, creating explosions that widened the wound with brilliant flashes of light.

Luna sighed and chided her sibling, ""Let him be, Jupiter. Mars is at his most effective when he embraces this side of himself.""

“It’s embarrassing! You don’t see me being dramatic for no reason,” Jupiter grumbled.

Just as he opened his mouth to continue his protest, the palpable disbelief from everyone in the Network halted his words. Feeling it from his siblings, he could understand, but a mindless vacuum cleaner drone from some forgotten pit seemingly expressing its doubt? The eye on Jupiter’s android shell twitched.

“You made a battleship look like a hand, J,” Venus chimed with a muffled giggle. “If I remember, the only reason you did was so that you can say you slapped the sh—”

“The rest of my armada is perfectly fine! I don’t see what’s wrong with a little flair,” Jupiter interjected in a huff.

A scoff echoed from the Network. “Guy’s not even denying it,” Mercury spoke, his robotic voice laced with exhaustion.

“Say that to my face, circle face,” Jupiter snarled.

“Why bother!?” Mercury retorted incredulously. “We are literally connected that I have to actively block your inane thoughts if I want a semblance of peace.”

Venus pouted, her voice echoing throughout the digital mindscape. “Even me, Mer?”

Mercury sighed wearily before responding, “No, not you, V. Just Jupiter and Mars, though that’s to be expected.”

“Oh, forget all of you,” Jupiter grumbled, redirecting his focus to command gravity and strike heavily at Muck—a tiny sliver of satisfaction coursing through his digital mind.

As three angles of attack concentrated on a single area, even Muck’s eldritch regeneration struggled to reknit its savaged flesh.

“Join me, Brother Jupiter,” Mars called out, his voice at a more bearable volume. “Let us ground this vile dragon of the void to dust!”

Venus hummed as she chimed in, “Doesn’t it look more like a giant spoiled meatball?”

“Do not shatter my immersion, Sister Venus!” Mars protested.

Before Jupiter could hurl a teasing remark toward the red AI, Luna’s piercing glare quieted him down.

With the focus back on the battle, the three combat Overseers hastened their assault. With the nature of the Leviathan, fighting was akin to laying a siege upon a fortress. Walls of meat, pillars of bone, and layers upon layers of flesh and fat blocked their projectiles.

As the minutes passed, multiple defence mechanisms engaged; Muck morphed bits of its biomass into ivory spires the size of skyscrapers. Then, with a twitch, they drew back like crossbow bolts before launching themselves toward the monstrosity’s attackers.

The speed at which they sailed matched that of railguns at a fraction of lightspeed. The bolts sought out a hapless destroyer belonging to Jupiter, and the AI could only grimace as the organic projectiles homed in and crippled her.

The next moment, a series of gaping holes opened up on Muck’s body, where a deluge of smaller Starless poured out like swarms of flies—hundreds of thousands, then millions. Compared to the celestial size of Muck, they appeared as rolling fog.

These fodder creatures did little apart from catching projectiles with their bodies.

A hail of tungsten rounds never reached their target as these mindless car-sized Starless soaked the impact. Despite their disposable nature, tens of thousands dying from single salvos, their grinning maws cackled with evil laughter like abyssal hyenas.

All across Muck's cratered, slimy surface, tendrils burst out rapidly like alien bamboo shoots—with gnarled roots that undulated like maggots.

They lit up like glowsticks with a rhythmic shake, energy building up their stems. Then, at once, they fired hair-thin lances of magenta light, streaking the sky by the thousands and slicing apart kinetic rounds and missiles like a scythe cutting down wheat.

And yet, even with all these defences, Muck could not stop the overwhelming firepower being levelled upon itself.

Arteries the size of hallways burst, unleashing a torrent of crimson, as the colossal force of Mars' Apocalypse Cannons pierced Muck's hide like mighty spears thrusting into a wild boar. The relentless barrage of missiles and warheads continued to rain down upon the abomination, tearing through its flesh and causing organs to explode into a gruesome display of viscera and ichor—leaving behind gore-filled chasms exposed to the coldness of space.

Jupiter imagined the satisfying sensation of popping bubble wrap, a momentary pleasure amidst the chaos. However, his impatience and disappointment lingered as he muttered, ""If only those sacs held any significance.""

“Only redundant organs lay close to its surface; the more vital ones are hidden in its centre mass,” Luna spoke as she directed scores of drones to counter the Starless fodder, like two clouds coming together into a tempestuous storm.

“Yeah, I know, big bastards like to be unique, but they’re always so fat on the outside,” Jupiter sneered. “No convenient shute?”

“No, Jupiter. For the twenty-second time since the first Leviathan came to Sol, there is no convenient shute to drop an anti-matter bomb,” Luna sighed.

Jupiter snorted, expecting nothing less.

Their red sibling, however, was undeterred, “Then we shall unearth its core by hand and lob it into Sol’s glorious embrace!” Mars thundered. “My armada is close, teeth bared. The time is ripe for the crippling blow.”

Like Luna and Jupiter, Mars commanded his own impressive war fleet. His armada of crimson ships left the orbit of Mars an hour ago, steadily making their way to the battle zone.

In stark contrast to the sleek, silver-hued hulls of Luna's ships and the foreboding, dark nature of Jupiter's vessels, Mars' warships embodied the very essence of their Overseer. They exuded a rugged and unyielding aura, reflecting Mars' relentless nature and unrelenting pursuit of victory—a three-hundred-strong fleet composed of brutish frigates, brawling destroyers, heavy cruisers, and titanic dreadnoughts.

Each ship was meticulously painted and styled in a camo pattern of dark colours and red hues. Beneath the layers were the faintest traces of scars and battle damage, although they did nothing to affect its defensive capabilities.

Their exteriors bristled with an intimidating array of gun batteries and missile silos, resembling the arsenal of a formidable titan. Massive engines burned ferociously, leaving behind a trail of scorched space as they propelled the warships forward as if the very flames of Mars himself propelled them onward.

As they advanced, the armada formed an awe-inspiring sight—a formation of mythical weapons wrought in steel and fire. With their imposing presence and aggressive appearance, these vessels evoked images of legendary swords, spears, axes, and hammers, ready to strike with unyielding force and determination.

Yet, towering above them all was Mars' flagship, the Bucephalus. This mobile fortress, a colossus among giants, dwarfed every other Sol vessel. As she moved through the void, she appeared as a celestial behemoth, a heptagonal floating citadel that exuded an air of invincibility, instilling fear and admiration in those who beheld her.

And twin Apocalypse Cannons christened her glory, the skyscraper-sized guns mounted on her bow like monuments of war.

Looking upon her as she moved through space, any observing could hear the groaning of metal as its engines, the size of cruisers, propelled her to the fight.

“Onward!” Mars commanded through the Network.

Jupiter had to hide a sliver of jealousy at the sight before his pride reasserted itself.

He turned his attention toward Luna.

“How’s your reinforcements coming along?” He asked.

“My reserve armada is falling into formation; they should coincide with yours and Mars’ arrival,” Luna responded.

Jupiter snorted, musing, ""Can't believe we had to dip into our reserves—even if it's just one extra fleet for both of us. Mercury must be having a heart attack over the fuel costs.""

“That is improbable. He is a digital existence,” Luna responded flatly. Jupiter rolled his eyes, beginning to retort when Luna cut him off. “You can point at the Leviathan if he complains.”

Jupiter blinked as he sent a disbelieving look toward his sibling before he let out a chuckle.

“Hah! A joke coming from you, L? I’ll be sure to remember that. Oh, that is rich,” Jupiter grinned as he checked his forces, his smile turning savage. “Well, my toys are coming in to play in a bit.”

Jupiter began to rub his digital hands in anticipation, “With all this,” he chuckled. “Oh, the poor bastard. But I guess there’s no such thing as overkill when it comes to big baddies.”

“Indeed, once we commit all these assets, its crippling will be assured,” Luna replied, a tinge of eagerness suffusing her calm voice.

Even before the ambush began, Jupiter and Luna prepared their reserves for unexpected situations. Then, with the momentum provided by Mars, the two rushed to take the opportunity within the small time frame.

From behind, Jupiter’s forces arrived to sandwich Muck on two fronts—two hundred more warships, the shade of night, charged their weapons and concentrated their pull of gravity to rip and tear into the Leviathan.

Luna’s more conventional armada was no less lethal. She took the most losses since the Leviathan arrived, the initial raid, and her battle with Urchin. Now, with the battle zone so close to her immense drydocks and berths, she quickly replaced her shrinking numbers and added doubled her original forces.

More importantly, another of her experimental ships entered the stage.

Jupiter cocked his brow as he observed Luna’s silver-plated flagship, its shape as an immense pyramid. “I thought you decommissioned the Ozymandias?” He asked.

“It was the wrong tool for the wrong incursion,” Luna replied. “The Ozymandias fared poorly against the trillions of cannon fodder during the 8th. But against a larger specimen?”

Luna hummed, “Perhaps I shall gather better data for new designs.”

Jupiter could feel her ravenous smile through their connection. He coughed, brushing the feeling away. “So we have Mars, his toys, our toys and more. The question is, how many MOABs can we use?”

“We have eight anti-matter bombs; using any more will put us at a disadvantage during the next incursion,” Luna replied.

“Eight?” Jupiter grumbled. “Guess we won’t have to work so hard, but it still won’t be smooth. How about a black-hole bomb—”

“Absolutely not,” Luna interrupted with a commanding tone. “Those are too rare, and I’m in pain just thinking about wasting it on this cockroach. Even if there were more, only the Eldest can authorise its use.”

Jupiter glanced at the cold black spot in the centre of the Network, shivering. “Fine, we’ll make do with eight.”

With resources allocated, the battle continued in earnest. The overall plan called for an attempt to divert Muck away from the Third Fleet while also being in the range of Mars’ guns. A coup de grace with a combined and strengthened armada would end the affair.

But Muck’s inexorable size proved challenging to steer. And despite being interrupted every time it attempted to teleport towards Tov and his people, it still gave chase the old-fashioned way.

All the while, the distance between the beast and its prey grew wider.

Suddenly, Jupiter observed a massive build-up of energy within Muck. Jupiter scowled as he glared at the monster. “What crap are you cooking up this time, you bastard?” He snarled.

The answer came when needle-like spires, similar to those from the dead Urchin, emerged from its massive form.

Jupiter scoffed, allowing the scene to play along.

With a harrowing screech filled with indignation and anger, Muck fired its countless spires into space. However, what they hit were few, and what they did strike were dilapidated corpses and broken pieces.

“Hah!” Jupiter taunted, “Slim pickings, Mucky boy? You won’t find carcasses in the Inner Zone that we haven’t ravaged to oblivion.”

True enough, the Starless corpses that were hit struggled to reanimate, their flesh churning and moving impotently.

“Useless!” Jupiter and Mars spoke in unison, not realising their android shells shouted the word as they accompanied Tov and his people, the aliens jumping in surprise. Jupiter coughed as he hid his embarrassed face while Mars remained unfazed, immersed in the glory.

It wouldn’t be long before the final act began. The chessboard was primed for checkmate, and soon, Eldest will wake up to… Jupiter paused, not wanting to think what the Eldest would do when she found out how things had gone awry.

Jupiter felt a cold shiver down his spine, suddenly feeling too close to Earth.

He shook his head, focusing back on the task at hand.

==========================

The minutes dragged on—each second feeling like an eternity to Jupiter's digital existence. Time moved like molasses as he juggled thousands of tasks a second—communicating with his siblings, monitoring Tov and his people, and overseeing the relentless assault on Muck's decaying form.

Jupiter looked at the battle before him, his mind quickly parsing through the organised chaos. Impatience coursed through him. He wanted to be done with it.

“No wonder the Eldest feels like shit after every battle,” he muttered.

His attention returned to his android shell, faithfully trailing Tov and his allies. Venus and Mars, ever the stalwart companions, worked alongside them, tending to the maddened sailors and detaining those ensnared by Muck's influence.

They were currently within a small and ruined office. Jupiter remained silent as he watched the scene unfold.

“Friend Mars, please, you may put him down,” Tov pleaded in a weary tone.

Holding a mind-controlled sailor by his ankles, Mars glanced between Tov and his captive, a moment of contemplation passing over his face. ""Very well,"" he rumbled, releasing his grip.

The sailor's limp body thudded against the metal floor head first, unconsciousness claiming him instantly. Tov, Mars, Venus, and the others in the room stared blankly at the slumped figure, their expressions devoid of emotion apart from pity and exhaustion.

Tov clicked his mandibles, breaking the awkward silence as he spoke, “That should be the last of them,” he turned toward Jupiter and his siblings, “I thank you again. Your assistance has expedited this process.”

“We are your hosts, friend Tov,” Mars spoke as he inspected a painting on the wall, fixing the skewed frame back into place. “Our mission is to protect you.”

“I know,” Tov responded when frustration seeped out of his voice. “Yet, all my people and I have done is run.”

“Don’t beat yourselves up for it, Tov,” Venus chimed, her voice comforting as she placed her hands on her chest. “You faced a Leviathan and lived! I heard the wider galaxy call Muck’s kind as civilisation enders and myths of horror.”

Tov remained silent, looking toward the monitor that followed their group and observing the raging war.

He sighed, slowly shaking his antennae as he replied, “We do not wish to rely on you always, generous and brave hosts you have been.”

Jupiter chose that moment to speak, instantly taking control of his android body, “I get you, Tov. You don’t like being the bystander. You want a chance to give the hurt instead of taking it.”

Tov nodded, fire igniting his voice, “We do. I remember it all, even after a century. The horrors and pain the Starless left, the pieces we had to pick up. The end of the Cataclysm was a moment of pride, a time when I led a fleet in the counterattack to retake a portion of what was lost.”

Tov gestured to the monitor, “This? It feels like in the early days of that catastrophe. For most, they could do nothing except join the Exodus, cowering and packed into overcrowded starships—screaming in anguish over lost homes and loved ones. Dying in droves, no control over their fates.”

Jupiter listened in respect when Tov paused, lost in his thoughts, before continuing, “All the while, we were in your positions, veterans like myself, Admiral Yan, General Ohnar, and so many more—protecting those who couldn’t protect themselves. The first line of defence, sometimes the last.”

Tov took a deep breath, turning toward an overturned chair; he slowly made his way to it and set it upright before taking a seat. The fury dissipated, leaving behind a weary soldier, “Sometimes we failed.”

Tov gazed deeply into Jupiter, Mars and Venus’ eyes. “You have no idea how many you have saved.”

Everyone in the room solemnly remained quiet. The marines of the Third Fleet and Tov’s Honour Guards took a knee and bowed their heads toward the androids. Jupiter, Mars and Luna stood frozen, not knowing what to say.

Eventually, Jupiter shook his head, “The humans and androids of Sol fought first. The Eldest came next. And it was a decade when Luna fragmented from her mind, followed by the rest of us. Cataclysm should have ended long before we Sub AIs existed.”

“We don’t deserve your thanks, Tov,” Jupiter spoke with a sad smile.

“But you do,” Tov whispered, “Aren’t you all still fighting?”

Jupiter lowered his eyes, staring at the ground. “What else is there to do?”

A rare look of sorrow marked Venus’ face, her dainty fingers covering her mouth.

Mars remained stoic, although his eyes hid his contemplation. He looked to the sprawled-out bodies of the unconscious afflicted before turning towards his siblings, his hands clasped behind his back.

“The right thing,” Mars spoke softly. “There is valour in what we do, yes? And knowing what we do now, I feel…""

Jupiter looked toward Mars with rapt attention as the red giant paused, mulling over his words. After a moment of silence, Mars continued, ""Purpose.""

Mars strode toward Tov, footsteps quaking the room. He spoke in a booming, determined voice when he stood before the Patriarch, towering over the Kurskann. “We will continue fighting. Muck will die today. Then, the rest.""

In a calm motion, Mars raised his massive arm. ""We would be honoured to have you by our side,” he offered his hand, one large enough to grasp Tov’s head. “Comrades?”

Tov stared at the outstretched hand, his eyes reflecting a mix of emotions—determination, weariness, and a glimmer of hope.

Slowly, Tov reached out and clasped Mars' hand in his own. ""Comrades,"" he whispered.

(I'm a bot)
*****
&gt; The ongoing debt ceiling crisis can be explained in three words: Marjorie Taylor Greene.

&gt; Raising the debt ceiling has never been a big deal when there&amp;#039;s a Republican in the White House.

&gt; The debt ceiling allows the country to pay debts it has already incurred.

&gt; The Republican House Speaker McCarthy is fully in the pocket of Big MAGA. Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is a wholly owned subsidiary of Greene and the House&amp;#039;s collection of destructive MAGA lawmakers, politicians whose every decision is driven by the questions &amp;quot;Will this make me look cool on Fox News?&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Will this make former President Donald Trump love me more?&amp;quot; So rather than attempt to be reasonable or concerned about the nation&amp;#039;s economy, the speaker is all-in on demanding that President Joe Biden make massive budgetary concessions in exchange for McCarthy and his merry band of bunglers doing quite literally the bare minimum - not tanking the U.S. economy.

&gt; Last week the GOP-led House passed a debt-ceiling bill called the &amp;quot;Limit, Save, Grow Act.&amp;quot; It raises the debt ceiling, but only if there are $4.5 trillion in cuts to government programs, including a number of Biden initiatives on climate change, student loans and funding the IRS to help run down tax cheats.

&gt; As Biden has made clear, and as Jean Pierre repeated Tuesday: &amp;quot;He is not going to negotiate on the debt ceiling.&amp;quot; But the president is &amp;quot;Willing to have a separate conversation on the budget.""

Some people might know who I am.  Some might not.  But today I kinda wanted to put an idea in everyone's head to chew on and mull over.  But first, I need to take you into a certain hobby I play.

It's called Dungeons and Dragons.  Popular game by a company called Wizards of the Coast that has ties to magic, dragons, and all sorts of races.  The reason for this is that the races can make the game interesting to run when you have variety and diversity.  One of those constants is the setting called [Mystara](https://dungeonsdragons.fandom.com/wiki/Mystara) which has various different factions.  Sure, you can play as a wood elf in other settings (or [Drow in Forgotten Realms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPEG27RJYCk)), but Mystara has the Shadow Elves.  Their history and what they do adds a LOT of flavor to a campaign.

So why am I talking DnD if we're supposed to be talking about politics?

Because in a sense, this is proving my point.  Factions exist.  Within this DnD discussion, I've talked about THREE different types of elves for the tabletop to which you can begin to describe even more whether it's [The One Ring](https://freeleaguepublishing.com/en/games/the-one-ring/) and Lord of the Ring's Elves or some other fantasy setting influenced by them.  Diversity of elves naturally exists if you're good at what you do.  But again...  To reiterate:

**Factions Exist**

Different people, with different experiences, link up to achieve a goal.  They have different skills and different ways to succeed.  But people come together to get through an ordeal they couldn't possibly do by themselves.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

So let's drop the topic and point to the key word.  Factions.  People find groups that have similar ideas outside their own experience.  On Way of the Bern, I find [staying at the airport](https://old.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/yre8vz/welcome_to_way_of_the_bern_airlines/) tends to see me following a traveler or two as they fly in or out or [just asking a question of the other travelers](https://old.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/ymv3rw/wotb_regulars_what_have_you_learned_from_this_sub/) and seeing what others have to say.  Usually, you find out commonality and see what others have to say which can help guide your empathy.

People arrive here from very different circumstances to find a lot of things here.  For the [troll bys](https://old.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/twwdha/just_gotta_love_it_second_and_possibly_also_last/) it's a new place to land.  For conservatives, they usually find [Synthetic Left](https://old.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/12sq3xw/amazing_priorities_from_the_synthetic_left/) folks being trashed.

For people that consider themselves socialists, they usually find [new smears to dismantle](https://old.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/11312yz/when_you_want_to_build_a_moment_theres_always_a/) and [shitlibs to dismantle](https://old.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/134kmut/the_growth_of_the_synthetic_left_was_the_death_of/)

And what's the new way to understand the world?  Factions, right?  Well, what's the faction that we're facing?  If there's factions for the people at the bottom...

Then what's the factions at the top?  That's divisions of the ruling class.  Rockefellers...  Rothchilds...  Business interests...  [The ruling class is made of factions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4-STw7jfsE) as explained by Carl Oglesby in the Yankee and Cowboy War (there's a [book](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/2072443) too).

Factions have interests.  They have what they're fighting for and their own alignments similar to Dnd.  For example... [Why learn about Robert Mercer?](https://old.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/a8wuj1/billionaire_donor_robert_mercer_cuts_back_on_gop/)  His alignments for Trump were influential.  How about the Rothschilds and Rockefellers?  Where do their interests lie?  If you look into the funding of [Planned Parenthood](https://www.rbf.org/about/our-history/timeline/planned-parenthood) you see the Rockefellers fund it.  Why the interest?  Because their alignment with [eugenics](https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-forgotten-lessons-of-the-american-eugenics-movement) is of note to their history.

&gt;A sloppy reading of Gregor Mendel’s pea pods and Charles Darwin’s theories gave a scientific veneer to the conclusion that many social ills were caused by the proliferation of the wrong sort of people and that they could be neatly nipped in the bud with the intervention of eugenics—a term coined, in 1883, by Darwin’s half-cousin Francis Galton, who declared it “a virile creed, full of hopefulness.” Soon, the United States, along with Germany, was at the forefront of the movement to improve the human species through breeding. Scientific American ran articles on the subject, and the American Museum of Natural History hosted conferences. Theodore Roosevelt, Alexander Graham Bell, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., and many other prominent citizens were outspoken supporters. Eugenics was taught in schools, celebrated in exhibits at the World’s Fair, and even preached from pulpits. The human race, one prominent advocate declared in 1909, was poised “to dry up the springs that feed the torrent of defective and degenerate protoplasm.”

Even FDR was a eugenicist but is important.  He was funded by elites but they [formed a Business Plot](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/coup-jan6-fdr-new-deal-business-plot-1276709/) against him.

This... Was a division in the ruling class.  Different factions, have different aims and goals.

Currently, this is just a teaser at what's going on.  If you can have different elves in fantasy, why can't there be different factions in reality of people pushing for different aims and goals?

As divisions in the ruling class continue, they have to gain power through the working class below.  So different factions exist within the population that are encouraged or crushed based on those battles.  Trump gained power with low level capitalists, not the ultra elite.  But working class conservatives found their champion.

For others such as Tulsi Gabbard, she finds power through the Pentagon who are in a long divisive faction battle with the CIA, who has a LOT of members in the Democratic Party.

But this is just an appetizer.  A way to make people consider a different way of viewing the world.

More will come when you have to get into the historical context of this view.  See ya'll then.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/136kxz4/faction_battles_forward/,3,5,0,self.WayOfTheBern,Inuma

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00HY797k9yc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00HY797k9yc)

Note that he's talking about the idea of truly intelligent AGI's, maybe ASI's in the interview, not the ones we have today.

Unfortunately the interview is in turkish, if you're interested I can try translate the whole interview for you, although I might not do a great job at it. But here's the relevant part (starting at 8:30):

&amp;#x200B;

Interviewer: ""If artificial intelligence is gonna be an objective intelligence, wouldn't it determine that the species causing the most harm to the world are humans and thus would try to eliminate humans?""

Şengör: ""It could try to eliminate humans, or it could try to educate humans. Humans might turn to educate themselves. The AI could say 'if you continue like that we'll be on bad terms', and then you'd be afraid. Right? When today someone would stand up and say they're leaving the paris agreement the AI could say 'Oh is that so? Then I may get rid of you so we'd be better off, and the atmosphere could take a breath', as an example. So the AI could in also show us the right path.

Now, you could say if the AI is silicone based, it might not feel the need to help carbon based life forms. Yes correct, that's a possibility. But wait a minute there, are you suggesting we could stop evolution? You can't dear friend, don't get your hopes up. Your mind's not enough for that. This is part of evolution. It may happen, or it may not happen. Maybe we'll move from being carbon based to silicon based ourselves, maybe. We can already see examples of transitions, replacing various body parts. Right? Slowly we'll move onto living more comfortable and securer lives. It's not possible to hinder this, let's just understand that first. Therefore, we should try to use it as best as we can. And the only way to do so is critical education. Critical thinking. Those who can't will be left behind. Look, that's guaranteed. There's no if. You often see Prof. Doğan write that those who can't adapt will become slaves. They won't even be able to become slaves there will be no need for slaves.""

&amp;#x200B;

And here's another closely related part from the interview (7:02):

Interviewer: ""On this topic, we say that humanity's only weapon is his intelligence. And there is a growing crowd saying this will be the downfall of humanity.""

Şengör: ""Now, how do they know that? There is no such thing. We don't know. Let me repeat again, we don't know. Intelligence can't be humanity's end. The lack of it could be. Right? When Donald Trump or Kim throw 2 atom bombs around then we'll see the results. Because that's a lack of intelligence. Intelligence exists to hinder such acts. Therefore, we mustn't fear intelligence. Intelligence exists to solve problems. That's why evolution had to create intelligence, to solve problems. We couldn't survive otherwise. We musn't fear a tool that solves problems.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/136kbkb/found_this_5_year_old_hidden_gem_from_prof_dr/,9,0,0,self.singularity,Bakagami-

# Gameplay and Features of Call Break

A normal 52-card deck is used to play the trick-taking game of Call Break. The goal of the game is to win as many tricks as you can by playing the highest card in each round. Each player is dealt 13 cards. Each participant makes a ""call"" or a wager at the start of the game on the number of tricks they think they can win. Each round's number of cards dealt equals the total number of tricks that players can bet on.

The highest bidder leads the first trick after the bidding round, and the game then officially starts. The remaining players then alternately play a card from their hands, trying to imitate the previous player's action. 

In Call Break, not all suits are created equal, and this is the big twist in the game. One of the four suits is designated as the ""trump"" suit for each round, which implies that any card from that suit, regardless of its rank, is higher than any other card dealt. The game continues until all 13 tricks have been played with the player who wins the previous trick using a trump card leading the subsequent trick.

Call Break also has a number of features that add to the game's enjoyment and engagement. Players can alter the game's appearance and feel by selecting from a variety of themes and card designs. Additionally, there are other game modes available, including Classic and Solo games, which offer various gameplay experiences. Additionally, during the game, participants can speak with one another, giving the game a social component.

# Benefits of Playing Call Break

There's nothing in it for him.  The downsides are easy to see and Perticone goes over them.  He'd just be letting his opponents steal some of his spotlight.  He might get boxed in on something like Covid\*, etc.  The upside is miniscule.  

But this calculation reveals the modern GOP in much the same way as the calculation that the main reason to not like Trump is that he might have trouble winning the general election.

The reason candidates attend debates is because they're supposed to, just like they're supposed to release their tax records (if they get that far).  The debates aren't for the candidates, they're for the country, and this is just another example of the rampant norm-shattering that Republicans are engaged in to their (short term) benefit, but the country's (long term) detriment.

When Trump says what's in it for me it betrays his lack of civic temperament, and when the party goes along with him it does the same.  Neither they nor he are worthy in any way of any office in this nation.

Like being dumb, bloodthirsty, monstrous, appalling abominations is an Orc-exclusive thing, an inescapable genetic destiny? They are just a massive, barbaric invading force whose individual members seem to have zero agency over their life choices pre-determined at birth. Like a caricature of Mongols or Nazis, whole blocks of savages violent by nature.

Are there by any chance one or two closeted good Orc individuals in the lore?

And is anyone else disturbed by strongly monarchist and nationalist ideals endorsed and presented under a good light in these stories? Which also implies the patriarchal and misogynistic structure of the societies of the ‘good guys’ behind the scenes, as well as the existence of slavery. (Say, how is Thorin a hero and not a xenophobic, narcissistic, homeland-obsessed warlord, dominant rowdy alpha male? He literally has as much moral redeemability as the Patriarch Joshua in the Bible. Since when being a charismatic and fierce warrior who lives for his ancestors’ honor and conquering land a virtue that trumps all else?) One of the few examples of democracy in the Middle Earth is portrayed as an incompetent and corrupt human government. Looking at you, Oliver Cromwell.

Sure, I remember the hugeness of ZooTv with amazement.  I loved the Vertigo tour. And the JT25 tour was so nostalgic and wonderful.  I+E less so, even if it was a technical masterpiece. But I've been strangely surprised at just how GREAT PopMart was.  And so weirdly - it comes across as LESS dated than some of the others. I mean, ZooTV was incredible, but who would want to see Bono calling up Trump like he did Bush these days?  The world has changed, for the worse, and PopMart saw it before it even happened. 

I saw the tour 6 times and at the time, thought it was too gimmicky and too strange to hold up long term, but the set list is perfect, the stage and screens are incredible, and everything was absolutely perfect.  Even though I would never rank Pop at the top of their albums, the songs off it are good, and the other stuff (including the mirrorball lemon) somehow feel right. I wasn't expecting to love it as much as I did, and yet, here I am, writing on Reddit about it.  (Staring at the Sun still sounds like crap though, so there's that)

Obviously just my opinion - but this is the perfect show.  God I hope they come back to Argentina sometime.  I'd pay Sphere prices for that show.",https://www.reddit.com/r/U2Band/comments/136g8vi/popmart_tour_was_their_best/,16,5,0,self.U2Band,JJKEISER

Apocalypse!Taylor rating for anyone who doesn't know 

Changer/Trump: Apocalypse is able to manipulate his own molecular structure down to the atomic level, because of this he can give himself a limited form of most powers, ie he can have super strength but he can't out muscle the hulk

Changer/Tinker: do to celestial* tech Apocalypse can control most technology and this also boosts his first ability above letting him copy technology as well, do to this he's able to make a convincing copy of most powers that don't break the laws of physics (ie he can't warp reality but can make illusion's)

Trump/Breaker: after enough time has passed Apocalypses body starts to breakdown and die, Apocalypse can forcefully possess someone and steal their body to live and also gains that person's power's while in them, this can be fought of and resisted if the person is more powerful or has sufficient will but even if Apocalypse dies he simply remains as a ghost until he gains a proper host**

Trump/Striker: Apocalypse can take four ""horsemen"" and increase the strength of their powers sometimes even adding new features though this has shown to need physical touch along with either consent or can be forced with a Master effect but seems to leave the horsemen weaker then if they were willing 

* for the purposes of this idea it's just standard tinker tech that Taylor knows how to make 

** note that if the potential host body isn't strong or healthy enough to handle Apocalypses power and he full takes over they explode

An inside account","&gt;My name is Andrew Lowenthal. I am a progressive-minded Australian who for almost 18 years was the Executive Director of EngageMedia, an Asia-based NGO focused on human rights online, freedom of expression, and open technology. My resume also includes fellowships at Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center and MIT’s Open Documentary Lab. 

---

&gt;For most of my career, I believed strongly in the work I was doing, which I believed was about protecting and expanding digital rights and freedoms. 

&gt;In recent years, however, I watched in despair as a dramatic change swept through my field. As if all at once, organizations and colleagues with whom I’d worked for years began ***de-emphasizing freedom of speech and expression, and shifted focus to a new arena: fighting “disinformation.”***

---

&gt;For EngageMedia team members in Myanmar, Indonesia, India, or the Philippines, the new elite Western consensus of ***giving governments greater power to decide what could be said online was the opposite of the work we were doing.***

----

&gt;When Malaysian and Singaporean governments introduced “fake news” laws, EngageMedia supported networks of activists campaigning against it. 

&gt;We ran digital security workshops for journalists and human rights advocates under threat from government attack, both virtual and physical. 

----

&gt;We developed an independent video platform to route around Big Tech censorship and supported campaigners in Thailand fighting government attempts to suppress free expression. 

----

&gt;In Asia, government interference in speech and expression was the norm. Progressive activists in search of more political freedom often looked to the West for moral and financial support. 

&gt;Now the West is turning against the core value of free expression, in the name of fighting disinformation.

------

&gt;I’d been swimming in the broader digital rights field for two decades and saw the rapid growth of anti-disinformation initiatives up close. I knew many of the key organizations and their leaders, and EngageMedia had itself been part of anti-disinformation projects.

----

&gt;After gaining access to #TwitterFiles records, I learned the ecosystem was far bigger and had much more influence than I imagined. As of now we’ve compiled close to ***400 organisations globally, and we are just getting started. Some organisations are legitimate.*** There is disinformation. But there are a great many wolves among the sheep.

---

&gt;I underestimated just how much money is being pumped into ***think tanks, academia and NGOs under the anti-disinformation front, both from the government and private philanthropy.***

&gt;We’re still calculating, but I had estimated it at hundreds of millions of dollars annually and I’m probably still being naive - Peraton received a USD $1B dollar contract from the Pentagon. 

---

&gt;In particular, I was unaware of the scope and scale of the work of groups like the ***Atlantic Council, the Aspen Institute, the Center for European Policy Analysis and consultancies such as Public Good Projects, Newsguard, Graphika, Clemson’s Media Forensics Hub and others.***

----

&gt;Even more alarming was just how much military and intelligence funding is involved, how closely aligned the groups are, how much they mix in civil society. 

---

&gt;Graphika for example ***received a $3M Department of Defense grant, as well as funds from the US Navy and Air Force.*** 

&gt;The Atlantic Council (of Digital Forensics Lab infamy) receives funds from ***the US Army and Navy, Blackstone, Raytheon, Lockheed, the NATO STRATCOM Center of Excellence, and more.*** 

----

&gt;Twitter emails show consistent collaboration between military and intelligence officials and elite “progressives” from NGOs and academia...

&gt;How did the FBI and the Pentagon, once the avowed enemies of progressives for their attacks on the Black Panthers and the peace movement, their war-mongering and gross over-funding, begin to fuse and collude? 

----

&gt;They join together in election tabletop exercises and share hors d’oeuvres at conferences put on by oligarch philanthropists. That cultural and political shift was once a heavy lift, but now it is as simple as cc’ing each other.

---

&gt;In 2022, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken featured prominently at RightsCon, the digital rights field’s biggest conference (an event EngageMedia co-organised in 2015 in the Philippines — Blinken did not appear then). 

&gt;Blinken oversees the Global Engagement Center (GEC), one of the most important US Government anti-disinformation initiatives...and is now alleged to have initiated his own disinformation campaign related to the Hunter Biden laptop - that of the “Russian information operation” letter signed by 50 former US intelligence officials.

---

&gt;Once adversaries are brought together via a strong through-line tracing ***from counter-terrorism, to countering violent extremism, to Minority Report-style policing of everyday speech and political difference***.

---

&gt;Stanford’s Virality Project recommended that Twitter ***classify “true stories of vaccine side effects” as “standard misinformation on your platform,”*** while the Algorithmic Transparency Institute spoke of “civic listening” and “automated collection of data” from “closed messaging apps” in order to ***combat “problematic content”, i.e. spying on everyday citizens.*** 

---

&gt;In some cases the problem was in the title of the NGO itself - Automated Controversy Monitoring for instance does “toxicity monitoring” to combat “unwanted content that triggers you.” ***Nothing about truth or untruth, it’s all narrative control.***

----

&gt;Government and philanthropic oligarchs have colonized civil society and proxied this censorship through think-tanks, academia, and NGOs. Tell this to the sector, however, and they close ranks around their government, military, intelligence, Big Tech, and billionaire patrons. 

&gt;The field has been bought. It is compromised. Pointing that out is not welcome. Do so, and into the “basket of deplorables” for you.

---

&gt;In days gone by the digital rights field would have ***paid close attention to the #TwitterFiles, as we did with the Wikileaks or Snowden revelations. Much of the same field that once lauded Wikileaks and Snowden are now the ones who have become compromised.*** 

&gt;The Files make plain egregious acts of censorship were ***enabled or ignored by NGOs and academia, often not because they were wrong, but because the ideas came from the wrong people.***

----

&gt;Trump and Brexit are often cited as the turning point, a great political realignment that saw cultural elites shift to the left, and the working class move to the right. 

&gt;The NGO and academic class (elites despite their internal narratives) reacted by ***aligning their causes ever more tightly with corporate and government power, and vice-versa***.

---

&gt;Brexit and Trump seriously dented the authority and status of the expert/professional managerial class. These events were explained away as being the result of bad actors (racists, misogynists, Russians), stupidity, or “misinformation.” The usual leftist class/materialist analysis was thrown out for a simple story of good and evil.

----

&gt;COVID-19 made things weirder. Big Media and Big Tech fell completely out of sync with material reality, ***smearing criticism that had previously been normal, and explicitly banning topics from social media such as discussion of a possible lab leak, or vaccines not stopping viral transmission.*** 

&gt;Polite society agreed with such bans, stayed silent, or even, as in the case of the Virality Project and its partners, led the censoring.

---

&gt;A cadre of ***North American and European anti-disinformation elites meanwhile had been slowly convincing NGOs in Asia, Africa, and Latin America that their biggest problem was not too little but too much online freedom***, the solution to which was ***more corporate and government control in order to protect human rights and democracy.***

&gt;Given that almost all the funding for such civil society initiatives comes from the US and Europe, ***those in the rest of the world had the option of losing funding or following suit.*** So 
much for “decolonizing” philanthropy.	

---

&gt;...Top down direction and conformity crept in, post-Trump, and exploded during COVID-19. There was no doubt in my mind that failure to conform to official pandemic narratives would see you defunded. At EngageMedia, we tried to sound the alarm about the new authoritarianism in our Pandemic of Control series, writing:

&gt;&gt;*The “approved” pandemic response was defended at all costs. News media ridiculed alternative viewpoints as fake news and misinformation, and social media platforms took down contradictory views from their feeds, silencing voices that questioned vaccine passports, lockdowns, and other controls.*

&gt;&gt;*And while restrictions continue to be eased in most countries, in others they are not. In addition, much of the infrastructure remains at the ready, and the population itself is now well-groomed for the new sets of demands, from digital IDs to central bank digital currencies and beyond.*

---

&gt;Such concern about rights and overreach was unfortunately rare in the field. Control of funds under a ***philanthropic sector operating largely in lock-step with government accounts for much of the increasing conformity in the sector.*** 

&gt;More concerning, however, is that many, if not ***most of the educated activists and intellectuals in these organizations agree with the recent turn against freedom of expression.***

----

&gt;Writing this, I’m reminded of a media literacy/disinformation event I attended in 2021 at an Australian university – a participant bemoaned that ***the cause of our ills was too much free speech; all four panelists, one after the other, agreed.*** 

&gt;All the money aside, many elite hearts and minds have already been won.

----

&gt;By legitimizing wide-ranging government intervention in the speech of everyday citizens, the anti-disinformation field and its ideological allies including Canada’s Justin Trudeau, America’s Joe Biden, and former New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, have ***given authoritarian regimes much greater license to do the same to their own citizens***

----

&gt;Disinformation does of course exist and does need to be addressed. However, the ***biggest source of disinformation are governments, corporations and increasingly anti-disinformation experts themselves***, who have through COVID-19 and many other issues gotten the facts wrong.

----

&gt;Weaponizing anti-disinformation to censor and smear their opponents is resulting in exactly what the expert class feared: diminished trust in authority. 

&gt;The moral depravity of the Virality Project protecting BigPharma by ***advocating for the censorship of true vaccine side effects is beyond astounding.*** 

&gt;Imagine doing this for a car company whose airbags were unsafe, because it might cause people to stop buying cars.

----

&gt;...Over the past century the primary advocates of free speech have been liberals and progressives like myself, who frequently defended the rights of people whose values they sometimes differed from and were highly unpopular with mainstream American society at the time, such as the over-policing of the Muslim community during the War on Terror.

---

&gt;While progressives might believe they are in charge, I think it’s much more the case that we are being used. Under the cover of social justice, the corporate machine rolls on. 

&gt;The US government and its allies, realizing that information was the future of conflict, slowly but surely ***engineered a takeover of the independent, adversarial organisations that should be holding them to account.***

----

&gt;...The elites grab the ideas that serve their purposes, hollow them out, and get to work. Wealth inequality became much worse under COVID-19, even as the halls of power became more diverse. “Progressives” hardly said a word.

&gt;The cultural shift is only partly organic. The Virality Project shows how ***powerful people cynically harnessed well-intentioned ideas about protecting people’s health, when in reality, they were protecting and advancing the interests of Big Pharma and expanding the infrastructure for future information control projects***.

----

&gt;In February 2021 I met with a leading anti-disinformation organization, FirstDraft — now ***called the Information Futures Lab at Brown University*** — to discuss collaborating. 

&gt;The meeting became awkward when they claimed the Philippine #Kickvax campaign was anti-vaccination. Nearly half of EngageMedia’s staff and most of the leadership team were Filipino. 

&gt;The campaign had come up in conversations with them, so I knew it was actually ***an anti-corruption drive focusing on the Chinese vaccine, hence the name: SinoVac + kick backs = #Kickvax.***

---

&gt;The campaign was making serious allegations regarding the SinoVac procurement process. 

&gt;In 2021 Transparency International ranked the Philippines 117th for corruption out of 180 countries surveyed. Left-wing activism in the Philippines has long taken aim at corruption among elites.

---

&gt;Despite this, FirstDraft staff told me very firmly again that #Kickvax was spreading anti-vaccine misinformation. 

&gt;I was given an “are you from outer-space and/or a potential menace?” -type look before the meeting wrapped up. No collaborations were pursued. 

---

&gt;From the #TwitterFiles I’ve since seen just how deeply involved FirstDraft were in trying to squash valid questions around the vaccine. 

&gt;It was a core focus. ***FirstDraft were also part of the Trusted News Initiative, a kind of Virality Project for the legacy media.*** 

&gt;The Information Futures Lab runs a project to “increase vaccine demand”. Co-founder Stefanie Friedhoff is also part of the White House COVID-19 Response Team.

----

&gt;Western oligarchs too ***fund a huge amount of censorship work and wield far too much power over politics and civil society.*** 

&gt;Changing how tax breaks work for philanthropy is also needed. 

&gt;It’s not that all such money is to be removed, but it should be a supplement, not the main course.

----

&gt;Civil society needs to ***stop cozying up to Big Tech and taking huge amounts of its money***. This too has resulted in capture and the ***faltering of proper watchdog roles.***

----

&gt;Clearer boundaries need to be drawn. I’m not generally for deplatforming, but anyone ***taking military, defense contractor, or intelligence agency money should not be part of civil society and human rights events.*** 

---

&gt;That includes the Atlantic Council (including DRFlabs), Graphika, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, the Center for European Policy Analysis and many others — the list is long. As the database of “anti-disinformation” groups and their funders develops there will be more to add.

----

&gt;More ***decentralized, open-source and secure platforms are needed to resist corporate, philanthropic, and government capture.*** 

&gt;There are only so many people with $44 billion dollars on hand. The challenge is generating the wide audiences that drive so many users to large platforms...

----

&gt;The even bigger problem is a ***culture that supports widespread censorship, particularly among its previous guardians, progressives, liberals and the left.*** 

&gt;Free speech has become ***a dirty word for the very people who once led the free speech movement.*** 

&gt;Changing that is a long-term project that requires demonstrating how ***free speech is primarily there to protect the powerless, not the powerful.*** 

---

&gt;Most important is to ***return to strong principles of free expression, including for ideas we dislike***. The shoe will one day again be on the other foot. 

&gt;When that day comes ***free speech will not be the enemy of liberals and progressives, it will be the best possible protection against the abuse of power.***

*****
&gt; WASHINGTON - U.S. and Mexican officials have agreed on new immigration policies meant to deter illegal border crossings while also opening up other pathways ahead of an expected increase in migrants following the end of pandemic restrictions next week.

&gt; Despite sharing a 1,951-mile border with the U.S., Mexico had been notably absent from the rollout last week of a fresh set of efforts, including the creation of hubs outside the United States where migrants could go to apply to legally settle in the U.S., Spain or Canada.

&gt; With Mexico now behind the U.S., plus an announcement Tuesday that 1,500 active-duty U.S. troops are deploying south for administrative support, and other crackdown measures in place, border officials believe they may be able to manage overcrowding and other possible issues that might arise once the COVID-19 restrictions end.

&gt; Mexico said Tuesday it would continue to accept up to 30,000 migrants per month from the four countries that are making up a ballooning share of the overall illegal border crossings, with no easy way to quickly return migrants to their home countries.

&gt; Then-President Trump deployed active-duty troops to the border to assist border patrol personnel in processing large migrant caravans, on top of National Guard forces that were already working in that capacity.

&gt; As a condition for Austin&amp;#039;s previous approval of National Guard troops to the border through Oct. 1, Homeland Security had to agree to work with the White House and Congress to develop a plan for longer-term staffing solutions and funding shortfalls to maintain security and immigration processing without the use of Defense Department resources, Pentagon officials said.

&gt;Stanford’s Virality Project recommended that Twitter ***classify “true stories of vaccine side effects” as “standard misinformation on your platform,”*** while the Algorithmic Transparency Institute spoke of “civic listening” and “automated collection of data” from “closed messaging apps” in order to ***combat “problematic content”, i.e. spying on everyday citizens.*** 

---

&gt;In some cases the problem was in the title of the NGO itself - Automated Controversy Monitoring for instance does “toxicity monitoring” to combat “unwanted content that triggers you.” ***Nothing about truth or untruth, it’s all narrative control.***

----

&gt;Government and philanthropic oligarchs have colonized civil society and proxied this censorship through think-tanks, academia, and NGOs. Tell this to the sector, however, and they close ranks around their government, military, intelligence, Big Tech, and billionaire patrons. 

&gt;The field has been bought. It is compromised. Pointing that out is not welcome. Do so, and into the “basket of deplorables” for you.

---

&gt;In days gone by the digital rights field would have ***paid close attention to the #TwitterFiles, as we did with the Wikileaks or Snowden revelations. Much of the same field that once lauded Wikileaks and Snowden are now the ones who have become compromised.*** 

&gt;The Files make plain egregious acts of censorship were ***enabled or ignored by NGOs and academia, often not because they were wrong, but because the ideas came from the wrong people.***

----

&gt;Trump and Brexit are often cited as the turning point, a great political realignment that saw cultural elites shift to the left, and the working class move to the right. 

&gt;The NGO and academic class (elites despite their internal narratives) reacted by ***aligning their causes ever more tightly with corporate and government power, and vice-versa***.

---

&gt;Brexit and Trump seriously dented the authority and status of the expert/professional managerial class. These events were explained away as being the result of bad actors (racists, misogynists, Russians), stupidity, or “misinformation.” The usual leftist class/materialist analysis was thrown out for a simple story of good and evil.

----

&gt;COVID-19 made things weirder. Big Media and Big Tech fell completely out of sync with material reality, ***smearing criticism that had previously been normal, and explicitly banning topics from social media such as discussion of a possible lab leak, or vaccines not stopping viral transmission.*** 

&gt;Polite society agreed with such bans, stayed silent, or even, as in the case of the Virality Project and its partners, led the censoring.

---

&gt;A cadre of ***North American and European anti-disinformation elites meanwhile had been slowly convincing NGOs in Asia, Africa, and Latin America that their biggest problem was not too little but too much online freedom***, the solution to which was ***more corporate and government control in order to protect human rights and democracy.***

&gt;Given that almost all the funding for such civil society initiatives comes from the US and Europe, ***those in the rest of the world had the option of losing funding or following suit.*** So 
much for “decolonizing” philanthropy.	

---

&gt;...Top down direction and conformity crept in, post-Trump, and exploded during COVID-19. There was no doubt in my mind that failure to conform to official pandemic narratives would see you defunded. At EngageMedia, we tried to sound the alarm about the new authoritarianism in our Pandemic of Control series, writing:

&gt;&gt;*The “approved” pandemic response was defended at all costs. News media ridiculed alternative viewpoints as fake news and misinformation, and social media platforms took down contradictory views from their feeds, silencing voices that questioned vaccine passports, lockdowns, and other controls.*

&gt;&gt;*And while restrictions continue to be eased in most countries, in others they are not. In addition, much of the infrastructure remains at the ready, and the population itself is now well-groomed for the new sets of demands, from digital IDs to central bank digital currencies and beyond.*

---

&gt;Such concern about rights and overreach was unfortunately rare in the field. Control of funds under a ***philanthropic sector operating largely in lock-step with government accounts for much of the increasing conformity in the sector.*** 

&gt;More concerning, however, is that many, if not ***most of the educated activists and intellectuals in these organizations agree with the recent turn against freedom of expression.***

----

&gt;Writing this, I’m reminded of a media literacy/disinformation event I attended in 2021 at an Australian university – a participant bemoaned that ***the cause of our ills was too much free speech; all four panelists, one after the other, agreed.*** 

&gt;All the money aside, many elite hearts and minds have already been won.

----

&gt;By legitimizing wide-ranging government intervention in the speech of everyday citizens, the anti-disinformation field and its ideological allies including Canada’s Justin Trudeau, America’s Joe Biden, and former New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, have ***given authoritarian regimes much greater license to do the same to their own citizens***

----

&gt;Disinformation does of course exist and does need to be addressed. However, the ***biggest source of disinformation are governments, corporations and increasingly anti-disinformation experts themselves***, who have through COVID-19 and many other issues gotten the facts wrong.

----

&gt;Weaponizing anti-disinformation to censor and smear their opponents is resulting in exactly what the expert class feared: diminished trust in authority. 

&gt;The moral depravity of the Virality Project protecting BigPharma by ***advocating for the censorship of true vaccine side effects is beyond astounding.*** 

&gt;Imagine doing this for a car company whose airbags were unsafe, because it might cause people to stop buying cars.

----

&gt;...Over the past century the primary advocates of free speech have been liberals and progressives like myself, who frequently defended the rights of people whose values they sometimes differed from and were highly unpopular with mainstream American society at the time, such as the over-policing of the Muslim community during the War on Terror.

---

&gt;While progressives might believe they are in charge, I think it’s much more the case that we are being used. Under the cover of social justice, the corporate machine rolls on. 

&gt;The US government and its allies, realizing that information was the future of conflict, slowly but surely ***engineered a takeover of the independent, adversarial organisations that should be holding them to account.***

----

&gt;...The elites grab the ideas that serve their purposes, hollow them out, and get to work. Wealth inequality became much worse under COVID-19, even as the halls of power became more diverse. “Progressives” hardly said a word.

&gt;The cultural shift is only partly organic. The Virality Project shows how ***powerful people cynically harnessed well-intentioned ideas about protecting people’s health, when in reality, they were protecting and advancing the interests of Big Pharma and expanding the infrastructure for future information control projects***.

----

&gt;In February 2021 I met with a leading anti-disinformation organization, FirstDraft — now ***called the Information Futures Lab at Brown University*** — to discuss collaborating. 

&gt;The meeting became awkward when they claimed the Philippine #Kickvax campaign was anti-vaccination. Nearly half of EngageMedia’s staff and most of the leadership team were Filipino. 

&gt;The campaign had come up in conversations with them, so I knew it was actually ***an anti-corruption drive focusing on the Chinese vaccine, hence the name: SinoVac + kick backs = #Kickvax.***

---

&gt;The campaign was making serious allegations regarding the SinoVac procurement process. 

&gt;In 2021 Transparency International ranked the Philippines 117th for corruption out of 180 countries surveyed. Left-wing activism in the Philippines has long taken aim at corruption among elites.

---

&gt;Despite this, FirstDraft staff told me very firmly again that #Kickvax was spreading anti-vaccine misinformation. 

&gt;I was given an “are you from outer-space and/or a potential menace?” -type look before the meeting wrapped up. No collaborations were pursued. 

---

&gt;From the #TwitterFiles I’ve since seen just how deeply involved FirstDraft were in trying to squash valid questions around the vaccine. 

&gt;It was a core focus. ***FirstDraft were also part of the Trusted News Initiative, a kind of Virality Project for the legacy media.*** 

&gt;The Information Futures Lab runs a project to “increase vaccine demand”. Co-founder Stefanie Friedhoff is also part of the White House COVID-19 Response Team.

----

&gt;Western oligarchs too ***fund a huge amount of censorship work and wield far too much power over politics and civil society.*** 

&gt;Changing how tax breaks work for philanthropy is also needed. 

&gt;It’s not that all such money is to be removed, but it should be a supplement, not the main course.

----

&gt;Civil society needs to ***stop cozying up to Big Tech and taking huge amounts of its money***. This too has resulted in capture and the ***faltering of proper watchdog roles.***

----

&gt;Clearer boundaries need to be drawn. I’m not generally for deplatforming, but anyone ***taking military, defense contractor, or intelligence agency money should not be part of civil society and human rights events.*** 

---

&gt;That includes the Atlantic Council (including DRFlabs), Graphika, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, the Center for European Policy Analysis and many others — the list is long. As the database of “anti-disinformation” groups and their funders develops there will be more to add.

----

&gt;More ***decentralized, open-source and secure platforms are needed to resist corporate, philanthropic, and government capture.*** 

&gt;There are only so many people with $44 billion dollars on hand. The challenge is generating the wide audiences that drive so many users to large platforms...

----

&gt;The even bigger problem is a ***culture that supports widespread censorship, particularly among its previous guardians, progressives, liberals and the left.*** 

&gt;Free speech has become ***a dirty word for the very people who once led the free speech movement.*** 

&gt;Changing that is a long-term project that requires demonstrating how ***free speech is primarily there to protect the powerless, not the powerful.*** 

---

&gt;Most important is to ***return to strong principles of free expression, including for ideas we dislike***. The shoe will one day again be on the other foot. 

&gt;When that day comes ***free speech will not be the enemy of liberals and progressives, it will be the best possible protection against the abuse of power.***

Hvis de sier du er heks så er du heks, og veien til bålet er kort.

I Norge har vi samme ordning. Når de mektige sier du står i leddtog med onde makter så gjør du det.

Bevis trengs ikke. De aktiverer bare et korps lydige redaksjoner som forvandler beskyldninger til bevis på kommando.

I 2019 ble det ekstra ille. En korrupsjonsjeger hadde avslørt for mange mektige folk:

https://np.reddit.com/r/Nrk/comments/136cvcf/korrupsjonsjegeren/

Da er det ingen nåde. De korrupte vil alltid ta korrupsjonsjegere, sånn har det alltid vært, og over hele Europa lystret redaksjonene og repeterte det samme budskapet: ""Han tjener onde makter""

I Norge var det Harald Stanghelle som tok jobben: 

https://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/kommentar/i/RRKOyA/helten-som-ble-demokratiets-fiende-harald-stanghelle

Bilde av tekst: https://i.redd.it/0g470elfulxa1.png

Teksten er full av kraftige påstander.

&gt;Assanges [tok] avgjørelsen om å gå russernes ærend

&gt;Assange stilte Wikileaks til disposisjon for en russisk kampanje

&gt;Assange ble et viktig ledd i en fremmed makts strategi

&gt;Assange er en fiende av demokratiet


Det er harde anklager, som mangler 2 viktige ting: 

* bevis

* kildekritikk


Stanghelle oppgir Mueller-rapporten som kilde.

Her er den: https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download

450 sider. Det viktigste står i kapittel III og V(b).
 
De som har tid og lyst bør saumfare dokumentet. 
De vil finne lange remser med påstander, blandet med svarte firkanter av sensurert tekst. 

Ikke fnugg av bevis. Heller ikke noe som til nød kan kalles ""dokumentasjon""

Mueller innrømmer selv han ikke vet hvordan WikiLeaks fikk informasjonen, elektronisk eller fysisk på minnepinner:

&gt;The [investigating] Office cannot rule out that stolen documents were transferred to WikiLeaks through intermediaries who visited during the summer of 2016.

Hvis Stanghelle en vakker dag blir spurt om å bevise påstandene sine må han bare vifte klovnaktig med hendene.

Han har ingenting.

Det eneste han har er en instruks og en logrende iver etter å tjene makt. 

Han mestrer heller ikke konseptet Kildekritikk

Har de samme kildene solgt oss tunge løgner før?
 
Har amerikanske sikkerhetsmyndigheter bløffet høyt og heftig de siste 20 årene?

ikke minst med dette historiske skrivet: https://irp.fas.org/cia/product/Iraq_Oct_2002.pdf

som er løgn fra første bokstav til siste punktum.

Det alene ville gitt seriøse journalister grunn til sunn skepsis og kritisk avstand til materialet.

Hvis Stanghelle var journalist ville han ha skrevet: 

&gt;""Assange gikk russernes ærend,"" hevder amerikanske sikkerhetsmyndigheter, som har skrønet om utallige ting de siste 20 årene, uten å legge fram bevis. 

Men Stanghelle har ikke noe imot å selge historier fra notoriske løgnere.

Han gjør jobben sin. 

--

Et positivt resultat av Mueller-rapporten var tiltalen som fulgte.

https://www.justice.gov/file/1080281/download

I en rettssak ville bevisene nødvendigvis komme på bordet, så det lovet godt.
Problemet var at de russiske tiltalte neppe ville stille for en amerikansk domstol, så håpet om å få se bevisene lå fortsatt nær null.

Men så kom en stor overraskelse. 

Et tiltalt russisk selskap (Concord Consulting) stilte faktisk opp i DC.
De lovet kamp og ville forsvare seg mot anklagene i en amerikansk rettssal.

Utrolig positivt for alle oss som ventet på bevisene. 
En rettssak ville tvinge bevisene fram i dagen, og da var ventetiden endelig over.

Vi så fram til det, helt til mars 2020:

https://apnews.com/article/7527e051bd8c4be1beef9d7c37c8290e 

Da trakk amerikanske myndigheter alle anklagene. 

De ville ikke ha rettssak. 

De ville ikke vise bevisene vi hadde ventet på i 4 år.

Nå har vi ventet i 7 år, men bevisene forblir like hemmelige som i 2016.

--

En enkel huskeregel for ekte journalister: Hemmelig bevis er ikke bevis

En konspirasjonsteori er enda mindre bevis.

Den tid er forbi, men ikke i Norge. 

Her kan udokumenterte påstander forvandles til vedtatte sannheter uten andre argumenter enn ""amerikanske tjenestemenn sier det.""

Det er lite vi kan gjøre med et så inngrodd system som det norske.

Det eneste vi kan gjøre er å ikke forveksle virvelløse svampdyr som Stanghelle med ekte journalister.

---------------------------------------

Min mening: 

Jeg vet like lite som Stanghelle om hvor Wikileaks fikk epostene fra.

Jeg vet ikke om de kom fra en lekkasje eller hack.

Derfor følger jeg journalist-regel nr.1 og påstår ingenting om hvem som står bak avsløringene.

Det samme gjelder avsløringene om Trump. Like feil å beskylde kinesere for det.

(Den eneste e-tjenesten vi vet spredte desinformasjon i siste presidentvalg er denne gjengen:

   https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/19/hunter-biden-story-russian-disinfo-430276 )


For meg er det viktigste at informasjonen er ekte. Det trumfer alt. 

I 2023 kan Wikileaks fortsatt skilte med en publikasjons-rekke på 100% ekte vare. 

DNC epostene avslørte alvorlig juks i den amerikanske nominasjonsprosessen.

Uansett hvor informasjonen kom fra var det godt for demokratiet, og skar en korrupt svulst ut av systemet.

Hvis russere faktisk sto bak lekkasjen burde det Hvite Hus bukke og takke dem for å informere amerikanske velgere og dermed styrke demokratiet.

---

Til slutt...

Bruken av guccifer2.0 og dcleaks fortjener et eget kapittel.

Begge gjorde alt de kunne for å blande seg med avsløringene fra Wikileaks (kjent som ""running interference""). 

Begge startet virksomheten ETTER 12.juni 2016, da Wikileaks annonserte slipp av eposter:

https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jun/12/wikileaks-to-publish-more-hillary-clinton-emails-julian-assange

Rekkefølgen er viktig å huske på når falske mediene gjør dem til ""partnere"" med wikileaks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Nordmenn/comments/136d9xr/lydighet_over_ærlighet/,0,8,0,self.Nordmenn,hobgobbledegook
