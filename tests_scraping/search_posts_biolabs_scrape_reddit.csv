So, if it's inevitable that Oshur will be revamped along with it's underwater bases, I'd like the underwater fights to be more like Excavion Cleanup Sight. Players would probably enjoy the fights a lot more if there were buildings underwater, providing adequate cover and hallways to fight in.  Also, I believe that when Oshur originally came out without underwater combat, the biolab skeleton in the center of the continent was going to be implemented into a real underwater biolab. But in the recent PTS update, the skeleton was removed (Sad!)

Yeah so basically I'd just really like to see buildings and cooler bases underwater if I'm forced to fight submerged. It would also add to the ""cool"" factor which Oshur is really lacking.

The [23-page UNDP report](https://annualreport.undp.org/assets/Annual-Report-2022.pdf) (United Nations Development Programme) for 2022 was released last week. Despite challenges to global resilience (especially in the Sahel), rising air pollution, the near-daily extinction of species, and a growing number of “fragile” countries, the report announced that “the future is hopeful.”

“**It’s getting worse and worse**,” [say the people](https://archive.ph/dsJrR) of Sudan, who have seen their country devolve into the early(?) stages of a Civil War that is rending the arid nation. A three-day ceasefire was broken on the second day, and the country’s largest flour mill has been destroyed. Over 50,000 people have fled Sudan, others are displaced, and others are pinned down in their homes. **500+ have been confirmed slain** so far. [The army is reportedly attacking Khartoum](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-65440528) from all directions, as of Sunday morning…

There is reportedly a **biolab in Khartoum** that [poses a dangerous risk](https://www.rte.ie/news/world/2023/0425/1378946-sudan/) if the pathogens—[cholera, measles](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-65390285), and more—escape. Khartoum, where the White and Blue Niles meet, has a population over 6 million; if the violence escalates, what will happen to those people? [Other actors](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/28/malign-actors-could-hyper-charge-sudan-conflict-say-ex-envoys) are increasingly involving themselves in the developing Civil War…

Our planet’s [oceans hit another record temperature](https://apnews.com/article/climate-change-hot-oceans-el-nino-la-nina-ec00bc89848d18dec9bf4db4444c999e) last week. Almost everywhere, surface temperatures are rising, and some of it is [being blamed on El Niño](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-65339934), the phenomenon that brings warm water across the Pacific to the east coast of the Americas. Where is all this heat coming from—and where is it going? [This study](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/15/1675/2023/) that came out two weeks ago tries to address the question.

Is climate diplomacy hopeless? Andreas Malm, author of the 2021 book *How to Blow Up a Pipeline*, [said so](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/21/climate-diplomacy-is-hopeless-says-author-of-how-to-blow-up-a-pipeline-andreas-malm) last week. He bashed Extinction Rebellion’s strategy of civil disobedience as ineffective. In Berlin, the climate activist group “Last Generation” [glued themselves to city streets](https://www.dw.com/en/germany-climate-activists-glue-themselves-to-berlin-streets/a-65416427) to disrupt traffic…

&gt;“...the COPs [Conference of the Parties Climate summits] are the ultimate proof of this [inaction/ineffectiveness]. Yes, there’s more intention to them, but **the COPs themselves have degenerated into kind of an annual theatre for pretending that we’re doing something** about global warming while, in fact, we’re just letting fuel be poured on the fire.” -Andreas Malm

**Drought may** [**affect the Panama Canal**](https://www.euronews.com/green/2023/04/26/panama-canal-drought-threatens-one-of-the-worlds-most-important-shipping-routes) soon. The artificial lakes that supply water to flood the locks lost 10% of their water in the first month of spring, since they rely on rainwater that is not forthcoming. 6% of all sea trade passes through the Canal.

The renowned Italian Lake Garda [is one third full](https://www.euronews.com/green/2023/04/25/deep-wounds-lake-garda-just-over-a-third-full-as-italy-braces-for-second-year-of-drought) now, ahead of what is shaping up to be **another devastating year of drought**. Italy [lost some crops to hail](https://www.ansa.it/english/news/general_news/2023/04/25/coldiretti-reports-widespread-hailstorm-damage-to-crops_8743c03b-ffdc-45e5-9f87-29d995f52cba.html) last week, while Tunisia’s upcoming grain harvest [is anticipated](https://english.aawsat.com/home/article/4293291/drought-hits-60-tunisia%E2%80%99s-grains) to be one third of last year’s harvest, because of drought. 

In California, which saw abnormally large amounts of snow, they will soon see [**abnormally large floods**](https://abcnews.go.com/US/california-communities-bracing-heavy-flooding-record-high-temperatures/story?id=98837547) as the snowpack quickly melts. Meanwhile, [elephants in Namibia](https://www.cajnewsafrica.com/2023/04/27/limate-change-threatens-namibias-desert-elephants-with-extinction/) are being pushed to death because of the devastating drought. Where is the balance between human and other animal lives? How many species should/will be made extinct by human appetites?

A *Nature* [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05875-2) explored the idea that icebergs melting on the other side of the planet [can cause warming](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/28042023/arctic-iceberg-surges-global-warming/) far, far away. The system is so interconnected that oceanic currents can be abruptly altered by large ice floes, and so complex that their impact cannot yet be accurately predicted.

A **heat wave** [**in Nunavut**](https://twitter.com/extremetemps/status/1651322552080375810) broke old records, with temperature reaching 11 °C (52 °F) in some places. New records set [in Morocco](https://twitter.com/extremetemps/status/1651297384838594569), in [Southeast Asia](https://thediplomat.com/2023/04/smoke-and-heat-breaking-records-in-southeast-asia/), in [British Columbia](https://globalnews.ca/news/9661630/b-c-weather-daily-temperature-records-set-april-29-2023/), and [in Iberia](https://news.cgtn.com/news/2023-04-30/Spain-Portugal-smash-April-temperature-records-1jpSWC0fQEU/index.html). Heatwaves in the Mediterranean [threaten to change the ecosystems](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/mass-mortality-events-invasive-species-100439314.html) forever.

Nepal [is expecting](https://www.laprensalatina.com/nepal-braces-for-its-most-polluted-year-with-over-9000-forest-fires/) this year to be its worst ever for wildfires. France [is **activating its wildfirefighters**](https://www.euronews.com/green/2023/04/28/a-very-clear-sign-of-climate-change-france-prepares-wildfire-fighting-forces-a-month-early) **a month early** to deal with anticipated wildfires.

[**Melting Alpine glaciers**](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/meltdown-2023-looking-grim-swiss-102505804.html). 

Mexico City is [running out of water](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/mexico-citys-thirst-for-water-lays-bare-inequalities-changing-climate)—well, the poor people are, anyway. Other water is lost through leaks, corruption, and general mismanagement. [Drugs](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/fentanyl-follies-loose-talk-washington-and-mexico-city-206426) are increasingly becoming a problem for Mexico and its northern neighbor. Authorities are concerned that [the **U.S. could receive over 10,000 daily migrants**](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/immigration-title-42-migrant-centers-latin-america-deportations/) from Mexico when some COVID restrictions end on May 11.

Earth has [continued **breaking ocean temperature records** for a month](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/26/accelerating-ocean-warming-earth-temperatures-climate-crisis), and it’s barely made the news. One professor said, “It could be a short-lived extreme high, or it could be the start of something much more serious.” Given those choices, I think we know which one it is. The rate of warming [is so sharp](https://www.commondreams.org/news/ocean-warming-study) that it’s stunning some scientists into silence. On the bright side, [global warming is causing more home runs](https://www.axios.com/local/denver/2023/04/27/global-warming-more-home-runs-at-baseball-colorado-rockies) in baseball…

Cuba’s [fuel shortage is so bad](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/cuba-ap-havana-pemex-venezuela-b2326102.html) that events are being canceled—unschedule protests may replace those events in due course. The nation’s [economic situation](https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/why-situation-cuba-deteriorating) is allegedly worsening, alongside its governmental institutions. Few countries are feeling the economic pain [like Argentina](https://www.centralbanking.com/central-banks/currency/banknotes/7958609/argentina-importing-banknotes-amid-high-inflation), with annual inflation rates over 100% and the country importing hundreds of millions of banknotes from Europe and China.

A [large counterprotest](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/27/gun-toting-prayer-reciting-protesters-throng-jerusalem-to-back-judicial-overhaul) marched in Israel *for* the controversial judicial reform bill that would grant the Knesset (legislature) the power to override Israeli Supreme Court rulings with a simple majority.

India [accused China](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/4/27/india-accuses-china-of-violating-border-agreements) of **violating its border**, part of a longstanding tension between the two giants. [Bhutan wants a border wall](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-65396384) to separate it from China. 

Ecuador’s Presidente [is facing a second impeachment attempt](https://credendo.com/en/knowledge-hub/ecuador-unrest-and-another-sovereign-debt-default-are-looming), and the nation is straining under its worsening debt-GDP ratio. Gangs are [taking advantage](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/23/ecuador-violence-guayaquil-guillermo-lasso) of the instability to make violence and expand operations. “A process of **urban terrorism has been unleashed**,” said one colonel. “**The government has lost control** of this crisis.”

Insurgents in Burkina Faso [killed 33 soldiers](https://english.alarabiya.net/News/world/2023/04/28/Attack-on-east-Burkina-Faso-military-post-leaves-33-soldiers-dead-army-says) in a surprise attack last week. In the week previous, [24+ were slain](https://english.alarabiya.net/News/world/2023/04/20/24-killed-in-two-attacks-in-Burkina-Faso-Security-sources-) by suspected insurgents. Between those two attacks, [60 civilians were killed](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/24/sixty-killed-in-burkina-faso-village-by-raiders-wearing-military-uniforms) by people wearing military uniforms; whether they were non-state extremists or government soldiers is still unclear.

Russia [made another missile attack on Kyiv](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/16357) on Thursday night, although most of the missiles &amp; drones were shot down. The strike on Kyiv was the first such attack in 51 days. Nobody died in the Kyiv attack but [several others were killed](https://www.dw.com/en/ukraine-updates-russia-fires-over-20-missiles/a-65457920) in other cities. Ukraine allegedly [launched a reprisal](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-crimea-drone-29218ed006a79c4b0629688ce4820cc8) against a large oil depot in Crimea, but the Ukrainian government has not claimed responsibility for the drone attack. [**Infighting continues**](https://www.thedailybeast.com/stop-deceiving-the-population-russias-mercenary-boss-yevgeny-prigozhin-threatens-full-blown-mutiny), supposedly, between Putin and the head of the Wagner Group, Yevgeny Prigozhin.

A [brutal retaliation](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-65381624) was made by police and civilians against 13 gangsters in Haiti: burning them alive. Others are [victims of gun violence](https://www.msf.org/haiti-violent-clashes-haiti-capital-leave-people-severe-danger), and some militants reportedly snipe individuals randomly from rooftops. **The capital region** [**is collapsing**](https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/04/1136057), and almost nobody wants to help people trapped inside.

One of the world’s biggest coronavirus experts [has Long COVID](https://www.afr.com/life-and-luxury/health-and-wellness/this-professor-is-a-global-coronavirus-expert-now-he-has-long-covid-20230427-p5d3t7), and he said, “**All the efforts that have been made in preventative medicine over the last 30 to 40 years have been negated by COVID-19.**” The CDC held a conference to share data and celebrate progress made against the ~~pandemic~~ coronavirus, but [several people tested positive](https://archive.ph/IKuW3) for COVID after the meeting.

About [**29,000 cases of cholera**](https://reliefweb.int/report/mozambique/mozambique-tropical-cyclone-freddy-floods-and-cholera-situation-report-no3) have been tracked since February’s Cyclone Freddy strike Mozambique. [Several thousand cholera cases](https://addisstandard.com/news-measles-outbreak-kills-eighteen-in-oromia-exacerbates-health-crisis-reeling-from-cholera-outbreak-drought-flooding/) have been reported in Ethiopia in the last week, a result of flooding several weeks ago. **Over 1,200 measles cases** have been reported, too. 

The American economy [dropped](https://news.sky.com/story/recession-fears-grow-as-us-economy-slows-sharply-in-first-quarter-12867589) more than expected during Q1. The [rise of shadow banking](https://archive.ph/OYBWN) is adding to the instability of the system. 

[**Blackouts loom**](https://allafrica.com/stories/202304240141.html) in Nigeria over lack of fuel. [Inflation is hitting](https://www.africanews.com/2023/04/26/kenyans-suffer-amid-soaring-food-prices/) Kenyan food markets. China’s economy is [allegedly deflationary](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/24/economy/china-deflation-economy-intl-hnk/index.html). 

Lebanon [is clamping down on Syrian refugees](https://www.siasat.com/lebanon-tightens-control-over-syrian-refugees-amid-increased-tension-2577239/) within its borders. One Lebanese politician said, “Tension among Lebanese citizens and the Syrian refugees has reached its highest levels, and **we are now in a dangerous place**.” Today, April 30, marks 6-months since Lebanon’s previous President left the job; he has not been replaced yet.

[This thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/12yp1ps/what_are_the_most_compelling_statistics_youve_seen/) attempts to crowdsource some doomy stats that illustrate the predicament our species has found itself in.

Planetside does this again and again.  Everybody plays on base X and they don't play on bases A,B, and C.  Sure, the lattice is stubborn at spots, but some fights draw a big crowd and some don't.  Even with a stubborn lattice. 

Ultimately it's because players LIKE that base.  And they do NOT like bases A, B, or C.  

So why don't we fix those bases?  Why do we keep messing with the one everyone likes?

This list of changes was made with consideration for both live and jaeger. I'll go by faction and cover some weapons, vehicles, and bases. This is by no means supposed to be an exhaustive list. Feel free to add feedback and some of your own concerns in the comments, though I ask that you all provide a justification for whatever issue you come up with.   


**NSO**: Here we go, lots to cover with the robot faction. Let's start with infantry weapons.

* ARs: Somewhat improved with the mag size buff, but I think these are all still undertuned. The refire delay on the burst rifle hurts, and the other two are just a little short on damage imo
* LMGs: 100 is good, 200 and 155 are less so. To me, both feel like they have too much recoil given their low dps
* SMGs: Again, these could use a bit of a buff. The PMG-100 should have a 50-rd mag imo, and the 200 should have like a 30-rd mag. I like the burst one

I don't have much to say about carbines, scout rifles, snipers, shotguns, pistols, or launchers. On to the Dervish and Chimera.

* Chimera: I think it could be a bit faster to make up for it's inability to ""tank turn"". Also, let's get that faction-specific ability released @ Wrel
* Dervish: Push this thing to common pool and get NSO a true one-seat ESF. Make it a bit more manouevrable too.

**NC:** Less for me to cover here, apart from some standout infantry weapons.

* SMGs: Bring the cyclone down to earth: take about 20RPM away, make extended mags add 5 bullets instead of 10. The gladius could potentially use a fire rate nerf as well
* Carbines: Bring the muzzle velocity of the GD7F down to 430 or so, or reduce fire rate to 800RPM. It just has too much reach right now for its crazy dps

I think NC also has a general advantage in LMGs right now, but it's close. Removing/reworking scavenger would be nice to give the big-mag lmgs a downside again

I've got nothing pressing in mind for either **VS** or **TR** presently.

**Common-pool weapons/abilities/equipment/implants:** Definitely a few changes to be made here

* EMP nades: remove/reduce the visual effect. EMPs are by far the most powerful special nade at the moment
* Grenade bando: Either remove or make it one level, adds one grenade. Particularly problematic for rez nade spam at the moment
* Semi-auto snipers: holy moly, if you haven't tried these yet do so before they get nerfed. 10 rds @ 450 damage is absurd, especially in combination with infil cloaking. The bodyshot damage needs to be reduced, perhaps with an increase to headshot multiplier. Same can be said about the bolt-action rifles. As a side note, the magazines of semi auto snipers and scout rifles are pretty huge and could probably be reduced to mitigate spamability. Quick video of 99SV farming: [https://streamable.com/b6nkp2](https://streamable.com/b6nkp2) 
* Infil cloaking is not fair with the weapons they have access to. Even smg infil is extremely strong in the right hands. Here's scores from a 10v10 match that demonstrate the effectiveness of both smg and semi-auto infils. To be sure, both players in this case are exceptional but are just that much more difficult to deal with because of the power of the infiltrator and its weapons  


[I propose that sniper rifles should be moved to a different class, and that infil cloaking should have a longer delay ](https://preview.redd.it/hxwkvhceggua1.png?width=1420&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b2bfe767703d4e5fb77b4f0cbc446a2fab85783a)

* Safeguard: A no-brainer option for squad play since it is just so strong. The effect should be reduced to lower resistance. Honestly just removing safeguard wouldn't be the worst thing. Revives would have to actually be safe
* Scavenger: Rewards dying, and buffs high capacity guns a lot. I think regaining ammo on sidearm kills is ok, but reload on death is not. Also would be nice if it returned a set amount of damage (in bullets) to the mag instead of a percentage of the total capacity

**Bases**

* Bring back old esamir bases wherever possible plz, the lattice simply needs more places to fight at
* Give biolabs hard spawns again. Especially if biolabs can't be bypassed on the lattice, they need to have easy avenues of attack. The satellite hardspawns were the right kind of chaos
* Containment sites: Make the attacker hardspawns permanent, perhaps reduce number of lattice links to each containment site. Knock out some of the walls to speed up access to each area, and move the defender spawn closer to the control points (maybe put spawn in tempest room, another SCU in current spawn area?)
* CTF bases: 'nuff said

Sheesh that was longer than I expected, let me know what y'all think. The upcoming Lanesmash season will be really interesting to investigate some of the recent changes like unreviveable maxes and nerfed A2G",https://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/12pjnww/planetside_balance_wishlist/,8,27,0,self.Planetside

# 66 – Exit Plan

Nobody knew of the existence of the biolab.

“You sure it’s safe?” Albert asked.

“Yep.” The Lair replied through the phone, in a similar way to how it used to communicate with Samantha when it was still the Quadrangle.

“Okay then, just wake me up if you need me. Analysis Mode.”

The biolab was a cramped room, much different than what Albert expected when he crossed the threshold of the reinforced double doors leading into the hidden area. It did not appear on any sensor, had no cameras, and was so hidden from view at the end of a maze of corridors that nobody could ever stumble upon it by mistake.

Good thing Albert could just teleport there. The Quadrangle did not have teleportation wards in place, as the technology was beyond what the BSA was capable of. Only the CARF did, on account of it being an HDF facility.

Inside the lab there was a mess of tubes and hissing machines hanging from the walls and jutting out of steel cased consoles reminiscent of a sci-fi era long gone, all leading to the central item on display. The brain.

In a jar, so to speak.

It was an actual human brain, belonging to the now almost deceased PsyOps, surrounded by a bubbling transparent fluid being moved around by the tubes coming in and out of the clear crystal dome that surrounded it. It didn’t move nor twitch, contrary to what Albert expected. Perhaps wrongfully.

Albert just went to sit on the uncomfortable lab stool that had been placed close to the contraption with the brain, and when he activated Analysis Mode, not even he knew what he expected to happen. He only knew that once the skill activated, he would hyperfocus on whatever task he had set his mind onto before flipping the skill on.

In this case, the task was to figure out how to steal the abilities of the psion and take them for himself. A fitting end, in his opinion. PsyOps deserved this and worse for what he did.

It was only after a few hours that Albert was finally done with the first part of the task. At this point, he had burned through almost half of his reserve of mana crystals – exactly 120 FU worth of them out of his 260 crystals stash in his inventory.

He scanned the brain with Appraisal, Perception, tried to complement his findings with the rudimentary theory of magic he was developing, tried to make sense of what being a psion even meant…

Then an idea came to his mind. He thought about how scientists measure particles by bombarding them with other particles and studying the effects that the collisions have. If only he could do the same thing with magic, and the brain that contained these psionic abilities, then he could gain precious insight.

**New Skill:** ***Usurp I***

· **I: You can steal skills from incapacitated or recently deceased entities. Activating the skill will initiate a destructive scan, leaving nothing behind.**

There it was. Finally!

Still under the effect of Analysis Mode, but feeling that the skill was about to end its course, Albert decided that he had no time to waste. He wanted to use Usurp while Analysis Mode was still active, of course, as to maximize the effects it could have.

“Usurp.”

The brain melted into mush.

**\[UNSTABLE Skills acquired:\]**

· **Psionic Suggestion**

· **Psionic Telekinesis**

· **Psionic Mind Read**

· **Psionic Solid-state Manifestation**

**\[No description for UNSTABLE skills.\]**

**\[WARNING: All Psionics skills require racial evolution to be used correctly. Until a Psionic racial trait is acquired, they will be unstable and have unintended side effects.\]**

**New Quest:** ***Racial Evolution – Psionic***\*\*.\*\*

· Find a way to make Perception Level 5 usable.

· Plant the Iperborea Seed to restore the shield around Elvenhome.

· Cross to the other side.

· Return.

· Reward: Race evolved into Psionic Human.

**Quest Update:** ***Body***\*\*.\*\*

~~·~~ ~~Level up your body with magic.~~

· Absorb 1000 FU of mana into your body.

~~·~~ ~~Reward: gain better insight when looking at your inner mindscape.~~

· Reward: Cultivation-Level hybrid System blueprint to develop your own leveling system.

· Reward: Appraisal Update. You will be able to upgrade the skill and estimate the power of an opponent as an equivalent level.

Well, this time the System was being very chatty. Too bad it was not the right time, nor the right place to stop and think about what the Quests meant and how Albert should tackle them. He had an exit plan to execute.

He appeared out of thin air, startling his grandfather who was hiding in a service closet. After the man was done trying to beat his grandson up, first because he thought the interloper was hostile, and then to punish him for making him almost have a heart attack, the two were finally ready to leave.

“How did it go?” Lloyd asked.

Albert gave him a quick summary of what he did and the skills he gained as the two finished the preparations for their escape.

“That’s ominous.” Lloyd said.

“And a possible pain in the ass,” Albert added.

“Okay.” Lloyd said after putting on his bulletproof vest. “We ready? It’s not going to be easy.”

He tapped the vest. It had been improved by Albert’s \[Magical Item Creation\], making it as strong and sturdy as it could possibly be. Not only could it stop a cannonball (or so they claimed without ever testing that particular theory), it also provided some protection to the areas not directly covered by the vest thanks to a weak shield it projected.

It had enough charge to last until they were out of the Quadrangle.

The two nodded to each other. “Time to shoot our way out.”

Albert teleported. Lloyd kicked the door open and leveled his shotgun at one of the guards standing in the corridor. The lockdown of the facility had ended a while ago, but fortunately all people inside the Quadrangle could be considered hostile compromised HDF agents, and the old man had zero issues killing them.

He hated Sekkers, and whoever decided to aid an enemy. He also didn’t care about being seen or recognized, on account of the fact that his permanence on planet Earth was coming to an end.

Two more shots sent two other guards flying into a wall before alarms started blaring. As the old man ran, he came across the unconscious bodies of more guards and Quadrangle staff. Albert was doing his job, although he was only incapacitating enemies.

A bit soft, the boy.

Several corridors ahead Albert was wreaking havoc inside the facility. Due to the fact that 99% of the personnel had just been shipped here from somewhere else after the PsyOps incident, nobody knew how to neutralize a magical threat. This meant that the Quadrangle, usually a fortress not even a powerful mage could penetrate or escape from, was vulnerable.

And he was exploiting every vulnerability. He still had more than 100FU worth of crystals he could use, and kept dashing and dodging around enemies in Bullet Time, while doing micro teleports to appear right behind enemies when they least expected him to.

The teleports were courtesy of Teleportation level 3, which granted him the ability to perform micro-jumps in a five-meter sphere around him without the need of the map. This meant that as soon as one of the guards saw him come out of a corner, he was already away. Moving at five times normal speed, he just appeared behind them and smacked them so hard in their vital points they crumpled to the ground.

Some of them were even sent flying, but never with fatal falls.

Lloyd followed. Albert made sure to cover both the front and the rear, and only occasionally did his grandpa have to fire his gun against guards spilling over from side rooms and corridors.

This wasn’t to say that the Quadrangle wasn’t putting up a fight. The guards all wore Kevlar armor that was impossible to pierce even with a close-range shotgun shot, probably enchanted. They could move and shoot incredibly fast and they had no problems unloading an entire mag on a teleporting young kid if they had the chance.

Albert kept dancing around and dodging – the Dodge skill carrying its weight when it mattered most. But it was hard to keep it up, and when he used the skill it was impossible for him to retaliate. This forced Albert to forgo the use of the skill the more the fight became intense, for no matter how much he dodged there were always more guards firing at him and the escape vectors of his skill were becoming too narrow.

Albert felt his heart begin to beat harder and harder the closer he got to the exit point. The guards piled up, and the corridors shrunk, and now he was taking stray hit that depleted his shield rapidly even as he tried to weave through the barrage of bullets.

The last stretch seemed impossible. There were too many guards, and it would be totally unthinkable to make it through while protecting his grandpa.

That is, if he tried to keep the fight clean.

“I think it might be time!” Lloyd said.

Albert knew it was true.

“Fuck!” He cursed. He didn’t want to do it.

“Fucking hell!” His grandpa responded in tone. “Just give it to me, I’ll do it.”

That was acceptable. Morally and ethically wrong but not *as* wrong. Perhaps he was becoming evil, he thought. Whatever.

Albert reached into his Inventory for the one thing they had prepared in case of emergency. It was something his mother gave him as a trump card right before he and his grandpa left for the Quadrangle.

“State of the art.” She said. “Courtesy of Transit Global.”

It was a rocket launcher. He remembered when he tested it in an empty field far from Temalas City. The thing was not a toy, and it dwarfed the destructive capabilities of even his high tier Fireballs.

“Oh yeah!” Lloyd was, on the other hand, very excited. “Gimme.”

He grabbed the heavy weapon with a grunt, went down on a knee with a curse that was very fitting of him, took aim and…

The corridor, the guards, the reinforced door behind them and probably a good chunk of mountain were immediately engulfed in flames. Vaporized. The shockwave was solid air that hit like a truck as it traveled down the corridor, depleting Albert’s shield while he protected his grandpa even though they were around a corner. The smoke followed.

“Gas mask!” Lloyd demanded, and Albert tossed him one.

He made sure not to look at the aftermath of the explosion as they left the Quadrangle the way they entered. There were mangled bodies, splashes of red under the debris and on what was left of the walls. Smoke and flames.

The car was waiting for them under a cloak that made it blend into the surrounding dead grass.

It was over.

# 65 – A lot is new on the planetary front

The heavy slab of concrete began to move after a loud hiss signaled that the mechanisms inside had awakened. Lloyd Cromwell took a step back from the keypad and stared at the moving door with a surprised look on his face, unwilling to accept the fact even as it happened.

“Unreal.” He grumbled. “They didn’t even change the secret passwords.”

“I mean…” Albert chimed in. “Perhaps they don’t even know there are secret passwords.”

“Well, they’ll know after today. Let’s see if my access still works.”

The two had arrived by car, making good time. The access was located at the bottom of a small chasm in the countryside around Temalas City, reachable after crossing some fields on a car that wasn’t made for doing what it was being asked of it.

But they reached it, and after knocking out the guards the two set off to work on gaining entry to one of the most secure places on planet Earth. Or what *should* have been one of the most secure places on planet Earth.

The old man cracked his knuckles, complained that the gesture didn’t look cool at all and only made him feel pain, and moved on. The duo quickly traversed the corridor leading to the Quadrangle while avoiding as much security as possible, with the help of Albert’s teleportation. Having already mapped the whole place, not only did he possess an almost perfect recollection of its structure, but he could also teleport behind the guards to make a noise and distract them long enough for his grandfather to slip in unnoticed.

Then, it was all a matter of pulling a certain lever and initiating a total lockdown of the Quadrangle. This is where Albert’s previous decision not to focus on reverse engineering the teleportation device meant that their plan had to get creative. Lloyd had a way in – all the way to the control room – but he lacked a way out.

It was a problem for later. For now, the two infiltrators parted ways. The previous head of the BSA beelined for the control room unimpeded, while Albert teleported to the biolab where the brain of the man who caused him an unfathomable amount of suffering and pain was still stored in some sort of stasis or suspended animation.

Lloyd Cromwell was already feeling off about the operation, and he had barely even reached the control room. It had been, simply put, too easy to get in. Something wasn’t quite right, and this feeling only got worse the deeper he ventured into the Quadrangle.

He saw the man with the cigarette strolling along one of the corridors, alone, fiddling with his phone quite intently. He also saw how the man quickly turned to run away as soon as the alarm was sounded, and the lockdown initiated. Unacceptable behavior. Back in his day, but even in Sam’s day, if the highest-ranking officer in the Quadrangle ever did something like this…

Something was off indeed.

Whatever made it easier for him to infiltrate the place also happened to leave the planet defenseless against the Events. Not good. The more Events happened, the closer the world got to the brink of annihilation.

Something the general population still wasn’t aware of. But, it seemed, not even the HDF was taking it seriously.

It was time to dig around and find out why.

Lloyd mumbled to himself as he worked on the many computers of the control room, looking several times at the screens before returning to hunch his back on the countless keyboards and touchscreen.

“A *lesser* old man would complain about technology becoming overcomplicated with time. But these systems are pretty fucking great compared to my times.”

After a couple of minutes, tense even for him despite his extensive field experience, he was finally able to access the data he wanted. And even if the HDF was looking quite lethargic, he had a hunch that accessing their data – especially if it was compromising data – was going to make him unable to literally ever step foot on Earth again.

They were not going to let it slide, not when it could expose their whole operation. But who the hell even wanted to live on a polluted shithole of a city when he could have Elvenhome and a whole valley of pristine nature for himself?

This didn’t mean that he wanted to see the world destroyed, however.

All that mattered was that Albert remained hidden. Which was ensured by the special cloak he wore, as well as by the collaboration of the Quadrangle’s AI linked directly to the Lair. As long as they didn’t meet any *considerable* resistance, they would be fine.

The ‘hacking’ went off without a hitch. Lloyd burned his access code, and in turn the Quadrangle let him see the files he wanted to access. After making sure that his daughter was receiving them through the Lair connection, he finally took a moment to inspect them. He had to wait until Albert, his ride home, was done with his thing after all.

Well, he could also hide so that once the lockdown was lifted – which was a matter of minutes at most – he wouldn’t be found. But he knew the place better than his own pants, and he was quite confident he could stay there another 6 minutes and 34 seconds before he needed to leave. Unless his watch was running late.

He remembered to rewind the spring last night, right?

He was getting sidetracked.

He opened the files. That’s when his jaw dropped as low as the fucking floor, and no doubt his daughter was making a very funny face in the Lair control room.

“Mother-fucking-hell. This is worse than I could ever predict. This is a fucking nightmare situation. They are all fake?! There’s literally no-fucking-body left here from the original HDF!”

Not one of the files could survive even cursory scrutiny by the former head of the BSA. Lloyd immediately saw that most of the information on them was fake, which meant that the Sekkers – the faction aiding the Lithoid Pilgrims with their not so good yet still very much unknown plans – had completely taken over the Earth side of the HDF operations.

With the HDF none the wiser, chief of all problems.

What the fuck was the HDF doing these days? He remembered the whole fiasco at Erebus, an event that confirmed that one of the most terrifying proposed solutions to the Fermi Paradox also happened to be the correct one. But it wasn’t like Erebus had been the end of them, right? Elvenhome was still there, Alignment Cutter notwithstanding.

And it’s not like their spacefaring capabilities were *completely* wiped out either! Granted, their strength and technology were sent back something like 50 years, but they were not gone. The HDF was not gone.

Well, they also lost all colonies outside the solar system, but most of their old-class military ships and equipment had never even left the solar system in the first place! There were some good battleships there to use. Some good old generals. Some competent analysts.

Shit. The more he thought about it the more information bubbled up in his old head, all of which pointed to a potential catastrophic situation.

He refused to believe that he was among the last of the old guard. Those fuckers met elves, they must have learned how to extend their lives. They dabbled with magic so advanced that not even he could begin to fathom what it did.

He refused to believe that the HDF was gone.

Besides. The HDF had to be still active in the solar system, otherwise there would be no humanity to defend anymore!

The organization was either utterly gone to high-grade cretinism and was no longer able to spot even the sloppy work the Sekkers did on Earth, or they were… well. Either they were gone for good, and all was left were the automated systems bound to one day utterly fail without anyone who could repair them, or the HDF was in such bad shape that they might as well be considered gone.

The last shield around Earth was failing before his eyes, although he could only barely see one of the blander symptoms. It wouldn’t be long until other, much worse symptoms would begin to show.

He made sure to warn Sam with an all-caps text message explaining the situation in brief, before he heard some noise outside. It was the telltale sign that his time was up, and he went to hide in wait for Albert to come and pick him up.

Hair loss is a common issue affecting millions of people worldwide. Understanding its causes, treatments, and prevention methods can help you take control of your hair health. In this comprehensive guide, we will discuss various factors contributing to hair loss, different hair loss conditions, their effective treatments, and other steps you can take to maintain healthy hair.

# What factors can cause hair loss?

1. **Genetic Factors:** Hereditary hair loss, also known as androgenetic alopecia, is the most common cause of hair loss. It affects both men and women and is characterized by a receding hairline and thinning hair.
2. **Hormonal Imbalances:** Hormonal fluctuations due to pregnancy, menopause, or conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) can lead to hair loss.
3. **Nutritional Factors:** A balanced diet is crucial for hair health. Deficiencies in nutrients such as iron, zinc, vitamin D, and B vitamins can contribute to hair loss.
4. **Medical Conditions:** Thyroid disorders, autoimmune diseases like alopecia areata, and scalp infections can cause hair loss.
5. **Medications and Treatments:** Certain medications and treatments, including chemotherapy, can lead to temporary or permanent hair loss.
6. **Stress:** Both physical and emotional stress can cause hair loss by triggering telogen effluvium, a temporary hair-shedding condition.

# Identifying your type of hair loss

There are many hair loss types, and knowing which one you have can be very beneficial when treating it.

First, it's essential to understand the difference between androgenetic alopecia (male or female pattern baldness) and non-androgenetic alopecia (non-pattern hair loss).

The former affects men and women differently - men generally have a receding hairline at their temples, while women tend to experience general thinning throughout the scalp.

The latter includes rarer forms, such as alopecia totalis (total scalp baldness), alopecia universalis (total body baldness), and telogen effluvium (i.e. brief shedding after childbirth or major surgery).

# How to treat your hair condition?

This is designed so you know the most effective treatments for each condition. This is by no means an exhaustive list, it's just a list of the most popular ones.

# Receding hairline

A receding hairline is a common condition that affects millions of men worldwide, typically caused by heredity, hormones, aging, and other factors. The condition usually appears in males between 30 and 40 years old.

# Symptoms of a receding hairline include:

* Thinning or balding on the top of the head
* Widening part line and sparse hair on the temples
* Itchy, flaky scalp
* Patches of thicker, darker hair or bald spots near the back of the scalp where new hairs do not grow
* Increased shedding from other parts of the body, such as eyebrows and eyelashes
* Weaker or finer hair on the scalp leading to breakage

# Recommended treatments for a receding hairline:

1. Essential oils: Natural treatment options like peppermint oil, rosemary oil, and lavender oil can help stimulate blood circulation, reduce inflammation, and promote healthy scalp conditions. Massage these oils into the scalp twice daily for the best results.
2. Minoxidil: This over-the-counter medication can be applied directly to the scalp to promote the growth of new hairs in areas affected by receding hairlines. Use minoxidil as directed for optimal results.
3. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) treatment: PRP therapy involves drawing a patient's blood, processing it to concentrate the platelets, and then injecting the platelets into the scalp. This treatment can promote hair growth but may be expensive and suitable only for some individuals.

# Male Pattern Baldness (MPB):

Male pattern baldness is a common form of hair loss among men caused by genetic and hormonal factors. It usually begins with the thinning of hair on the temples and crown of the head, resulting in a receding hairline or bald spots. In some cases, it can even lead to complete baldness.

# Symptoms of male pattern baldness:

* Gradual thinning of hair at the crown or top of the head
* Receding hairline around the temples and a generally sparse appearance
* Increased shedding
* Excessive oiliness or dryness of the scalp
* Irritation or inflammation
* In advanced cases, bald spots may form on the scalp or forehead

# Recommended treatments for male pattern baldness:

1. Medications: Topical minoxidil and oral finasteride are both available to treat male pattern baldness. Minoxidil can be applied directly to the scalp twice a day to promote hair growth, while finasteride is a pill that reduces the production of DHT, the hormone linked to male pattern baldness.
2. Hair Transplants: Hair transplants involve removing healthy hair follicles from the back or sides of the head and implanting them into areas where hair has been lost. This surgical solution can be successful but costly and may not be suitable for everyone.
3. Scandinavian Biolabs Hair Growth Routine: Designed to address early-stage non-scarring hair loss, including androgenetic alopecia, this natural hair growth solution harnesses the power of bioactive ingredients to help strengthen hair, reduce hair loss, and stimulate new growth.

# Alopecia Areata:

Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disorder that causes patchy hair loss on the scalp, face, and other parts of the body. The immune system attacks hair follicles, leading to hair loss in small, round patches.

# Symptoms of alopecia areata (continued):

* Sudden onset of one or more round, smooth patches of hair loss on the scalp or other body parts
* The skin in these areas is usually not inflamed or scaly
* Scaling and inflammation on the scalp
* Dandruff-like flaking
* Hair loss on other areas of the body, such as the beard or eyebrows
* Sometimes, the affected area may have a burning or itchy sensation

# Recommended treatments for alopecia areata:

1. Topical corticosteroids: These medications help reduce inflammation in the scalp and promote hair regrowth. Intralesional corticosteroids may also be used for this purpose.
2. Medications like minoxidil and anthralin can help promote hair regrowth in some individuals.
3. Scalp-cooling caps or cold caps can be used to reduce inflammation and improve the effectiveness of topical corticosteroids.
4. Immunotherapy: This treatment stimulates an immune response to promote hair regrowth and may be beneficial for some people with alopecia areata.

# Telogen Effluvium:

Telogen effluvium is a temporary increase in hair shedding caused by various factors, such as stress, illness, surgery, or significant weight loss. Hair shedding typically occurs 2-3 months after the triggering event and can last for several months before resolving.

# Symptoms of telogen effluvium:

* Rapid, noticeable thinning or shedding of scalp hair
* Excessive amounts of hair in the shower drain or on pillows after sleeping
* Small ""peach fuzz"" hairs on the scalp
* Visible scalp through thinning hair
* Itching, burning, or redness of the scalp
* Loss of eyebrows or eyelashes in some cases

# Recommended treatments for telogen effluvium:

1. Address the underlying cause: Treat hormonal imbalances or nutritional deficiencies that may be contributing to hair loss. This may involve taking medications or supplements to balance hormones and provide essential nutrients.
2. Stress management: Practice relaxation techniques such as yoga and meditation to help reduce stress levels.
3. Medications: Prescription medications like minoxidil (Rogaine) and finasteride (Propecia) can help reverse telogen effluvium by promoting hair growth.
4. Hair transplant: In some cases, a hair transplant may be necessary to restore lost hair due to telogen effluvium. This involves removing healthy follicles from the back of the head and transplanting them to areas of thinning or baldness.
5. Scandinavian Biolabs Hair Growth Routine: This natural hair growth solution is recommended for early-stage non-scarring hair loss, including telogen effluvium. The Hair Growth Routine's bioactive ingredients can help strengthen hair, reduce hair loss, and promote new growth.

# Anagen Effluvium:

Anagen effluvium is a type of hair loss caused by an interruption to the normal growth cycle of the hair follicle. This can occur when the cells producing new hairs are damaged or destroyed, leading to rapid hair shedding. Chemotherapy treatments, some medications, certain medical conditions, and nutritional deficiencies can trigger anagen effluvium.

# Symptoms of anagen effluvium:

* Rapid hair loss, usually within 2 to 4 weeks after the triggering event
* Hair thinning, with a reduction in overall hair volume
* Patches of baldness on the scalp or other areas of the body where hair is present
* Brittle, easily broken hair
* An itchy, scaly scalp or lesions on the scalp or other body areas with hair loss
* Eyebrows and eyelashes may be affected in some cases

# Recommended treatments for anagen effluvium:

1. Minoxidil: This topical medication can be applied directly to the scalp to help stimulate hair growth and reduce hair loss.
2. Steroid injections: Corticosteroid injections can help suppress scalp inflammation and promote hair regrowth.
3. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy: This treatment involves taking a blood sample from the patient and injecting it into the scalp to stimulate hair growth.
4. Hair transplantation: For severe cases of anagen effluvium, a hair transplant may be necessary to restore lost hair. The hair follicles are taken from another area of the scalp and implanted in the affected area.
5. Hair Nutrient Tablets by Scandinavian Biolabs: These multivitamins are enriched with essential nutrients like zinc, riboflavin, and other vitamins that support healthy hair growth.

# Traction Alopecia:

Traction alopecia is hair loss caused by prolonged, constant tension on the scalp. It can occur from hairstyles that pull too tightly on the follicles, such as tight buns, braids, and ponytails. Traction alopecia is commonly seen in African Americans, but anyone can be affected by it.

# Symptoms of traction alopecia:

* Thinning hair and bald patches in areas repeatedly exposed to tight hairstyles
* Tenderness or burning sensations on the scalp and itching
* Inflammation or open sores (known as folliculitis) due to excessive tension placed on the hair follicles
* Hair loss may spread beyond the initial area of damage, and other scalp issues, such as scarring or infections, may occur

# Recommended treatments for traction alopecia:

1. Removal of the cause: Avoid activities that cause excess tension on the scalp, such as tight hairstyles or clips. Wearing protective hairstyles, like loose braids or ponytails, can help prevent traction alopecia from reoccurring.
2. Scandinavian Biolabs Hair Growth Routine: This natural hair growth solution is designed to address early-stage non-scarring hair loss, including traction alopecia. The Hair Growth Routine's bioactive ingredients can help strengthen hair, reduce hair loss, and promote new growth.
3. Essential oil massage: Massaging the scalp with essential oils like lavender and rosemary can help stimulate hair growth. Alternatively, try a [hair protection oil](https://scandinavianbiolabs.com/products/hair-protection-oil) – a blend of essential and beneficial oils designed to revitalize your hair.
4. Maintain a healthy diet: Ensuring a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle can improve the overall health of the scalp and hair. If left untreated, traction alopecia can lead to permanent baldness.

# Scalp Psoriasis

Scalp psoriasis is a prevalent skin condition that affects millions of people globally. It is characterized by red, scaly patches on the scalp, leading to itching, burning, discomfort, and even hair loss. By understanding the symptoms and recommended treatments for scalp psoriasis, you can better manage this condition and reduce its impact on your hair health.

# Symptoms of scalp psoriasis:

Depending on the severity, symptoms of scalp psoriasis can vary. Common symptoms include:

* Itchy, scaly patches on the scalp
* Redness and inflammation
* Thick, silvery scales or plaques that may appear as large patches
* Hair loss in patchy areas
* Burning or soreness
* Stiffness in the scalp
* Flaking skin that may appear on clothes or furniture

# Recommended treatments for scalp psoriasis:

1. Topical medications: corticosteroids, calcipotriol, coal tar products, dithranol, and salicylic acid.
2. Oral or injected medications: to control inflammation and reduce scaling.
3. Light therapy: beneficial for scalp psoriasis alone or combined with topical medications.
4. Lifestyle changes: stress reduction, diet improvement, and regular exercise to reduce flare-ups.
5. Self-care measures: avoid scratching the scalp, and use gentle shampoos designed for scalp psoriasis.

# Trichotillomania

Trichotillomania, or hair-pulling disorder, is a psychological condition marked by a recurrent urge to pull out one's hair. This behavior can lead to noticeable hair thinning, patchy baldness, or even complete hair loss in severe cases.

# Symptoms of trichotillomania

Common symptoms associated with trichotillomania include:

* Obsessive thoughts or urges to pull out hair
* Feelings of tension before and relief after hair-pulling
* Frequent playing with, twirling, or rubbing pulled-out hair
* Inability to resist hair-pulling in specific situations or when experiencing certain emotions
* Noticeable bald patches on the scalp and other areas of the body
* Emotional distress related to hair-pulling, such as guilt or shame
* Excessive grooming behaviors leading to hair loss, such as over-combing or brushing
* Feelings of satisfaction when looking at pulled-out hair
* Using techniques to disguise bald patches, such as wearing hats or frequently changing hairstyles

# Recommended treatments for trichotillomania

1. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): helps identify and modify thoughts, feelings, and behaviors contributing to hair-pulling urges.
2. Medications: antidepressants or antipsychotics to reduce hair-pulling urges and relieve symptoms.
3. Habit Reversal Training (HRT): a type of CBT that helps identify and modify hair-pulling behaviors.
4. Support Groups: provide a safe place to share experiences, build coping skills, and reduce stigma.

# Female Pattern Baldness

Female pattern baldness, or androgenetic alopecia, is a common type of hair loss affecting millions of women worldwide. It usually begins in the 40s and can continue until menopause. The primary cause is an excess of androgens or male hormones, which causes hair follicles to shrink, leading to thinning hair on the scalp.

# Symptoms of female pattern baldness

Common signs and symptoms include:

* Gradual thinning on top of the head
* Receding hairline, especially at temples
* Widening of the center hair part
* Increased hair shedding on a pillow in the morning
* An overall decrease in scalp coverage
* Visible bald patches (in advanced cases)
* Hair shedding or breakage

# Recommended treatments for female pattern baldness

1. Medications: Finasteride (Propecia) and minoxidil (Rogaine) are commonly used to treat female pattern baldness. Finasteride blocks the conversion of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), while minoxidil promotes hair growth by increasing blood flow to the scalp.
2. Laser Therapy: Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) is a non-invasive treatment shown to reduce hair loss and promote new hair growth in some women. It uses low-intensity lasers to stimulate the scalp, increasing circulation and encouraging follicles to enter the anagen phase of the hair growth cycle.
3. Hair Transplant Surgery: This procedure involves transplanting healthy hair from an area of the scalp with thicker hair to balding areas. The transplanted hairs will grow naturally in the new location, providing a permanent solution to female pattern baldness.
4. Scandinavian Biolabs Hair Growth Routine: Designed to address early-stage non-scarring hair loss, including androgenetic alopecia, this natural hair growth solution harnesses the power of bioactive ingredients to help strengthen hair, reduce hair loss, and stimulate new growth.

# Hairline recession &amp; thinning at the crown

Hairline recession and thinning at the crown can be distressing for many people, especially those who had a full head of hair in their younger years. This issue affects both men and women but is more common in men.

# Symptoms of hairline recession &amp; thinning at the crown

* Widening of the central and frontal hair part line
* Visible scalp on forehead, temples, or crown areas
* Reduced amount of hairs in specific areas
* An overall decrease in fullness and body of hair along the parting line
* Widening of the scalp line with a receding hairline
* Hair loss in patches, mainly on the crown area
* Breakage or shedding hairs along the parting lines or around the crown area

# Recommended Treatments for Hairline Recession &amp; Thinning at the Crown

1. Minoxidil: Minoxidil is a topical medication applied directly to the scalp, available in over-the-counter and prescription formulas. It stimulates hair growth and makes existing hairs stronger and thicker.
2. Finasteride: This medication is taken orally, usually once a day, and works to block the production of DHT (dihydrotestosterone), a significant contributing factor in male pattern baldness.
3. Platelet-rich Plasma Therapy: Platelet-rich plasma therapy (PRP) is a treatment that uses the patient's blood to stimulate hair growth. It injects the patient's plasma, containing high platelets and other healing factors, directly into the scalp.
4. Hair Transplant: A hair transplant is a surgical procedure that involves transferring hair follicles from one part of the scalp to another. It can treat hairline recession and thinning at the crown.
5. Laser Therapy: Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) is a newer form of treatment that uses light energy to stimulate hair growth. The lasers are typically painless and can treat both men and women experiencing hair loss.",https://www.reddit.com/r/alopecia/comments/12muz4l/a_more_practical_straightforward_hair_loss_guide/,2,1,0,self.alopecia

This can occur when the cells producing new hairs are damaged or destroyed, leading to rapid hair shedding. Chemotherapy treatments, some medications, certain medical conditions, and nutritional deficiencies can trigger anagen effluvium.

# Symptoms of anagen effluvium:

* Rapid hair loss, usually within 2 to 4 weeks after the triggering event
* Hair thinning, with a reduction in overall hair volume
* Patches of baldness on the scalp or other areas of the body where hair is present
* Brittle, easily broken hair
* An itchy, scaly scalp or lesions on the scalp or other body areas with hair loss
* Eyebrows and eyelashes may be affected in some cases

# Recommended treatments for anagen effluvium:

1. Minoxidil: This topical medication can be applied directly to the scalp to help stimulate hair growth and reduce hair loss.
2. Steroid injections: Corticosteroid injections can help suppress scalp inflammation and promote hair regrowth.
3. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy: This treatment involves taking a blood sample from the patient and injecting it into the scalp to stimulate hair growth.
4. Hair transplantation: For severe cases of anagen effluvium, a hair transplant may be necessary to restore lost hair. The hair follicles are taken from another area of the scalp and implanted in the affected area.
5. Hair Nutrient Tablets by Scandinavian Biolabs: These multivitamins are enriched with essential nutrients like zinc, riboflavin, and other vitamins that support healthy hair growth.

# Traction Alopecia:

Traction alopecia is hair loss caused by prolonged, constant tension on the scalp. It can occur from hairstyles that pull too tightly on the follicles, such as tight buns, braids, and ponytails. Traction alopecia is commonly seen in African Americans, but anyone can be affected by it.

# Symptoms of traction alopecia:

* Thinning hair and bald patches in areas repeatedly exposed to tight hairstyles
* Tenderness or burning sensations on the scalp and itching
* Inflammation or open sores (known as folliculitis) due to excessive tension placed on the hair follicles
* Hair loss may spread beyond the initial area of damage, and other scalp issues, such as scarring or infections, may occur

# Recommended treatments for traction alopecia:

1. Removal of the cause: Avoid activities that cause excess tension on the scalp, such as tight hairstyles or clips. Wearing protective hairstyles, like loose braids or ponytails, can help prevent traction alopecia from reoccurring.
2.  Scandinavian Biolabs Hair Growth Routine: This natural hair growth solution is designed to address early-stage non-scarring hair loss, including traction alopecia. The Hair Growth Routine's bioactive ingredients can help strengthen hair, reduce hair loss, and promote new growth. 
3. Essential oil massage: Massaging the scalp with essential oils like lavender and rosemary can help stimulate hair growth. Alternatively, try a [hair protection oil](https://scandinavianbiolabs.com/products/hair-protection-oil) – a blend of essential and beneficial oils designed to revitalize your hair.
4. Maintain a healthy diet: Ensuring a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle can improve the overall health of the scalp and hair. If left untreated, traction alopecia can lead to permanent baldness.

# Scalp Psoriasis

Scalp psoriasis is a prevalent skin condition that affects millions of people globally. It is characterized by red, scaly patches on the scalp, leading to itching, burning, discomfort, and even hair loss. By understanding the symptoms and recommended treatments for scalp psoriasis, you can better manage this condition and reduce its impact on your hair health.

# Symptoms of scalp psoriasis:

Depending on the severity, symptoms of scalp psoriasis can vary. Common symptoms include:

* Itchy, scaly patches on the scalp
* Redness and inflammation
* Thick, silvery scales or plaques that may appear as large patches
* Hair loss in patchy areas
* Burning or soreness
* Stiffness in the scalp
* Flaking skin that may appear on clothes or furniture

# Recommended treatments for scalp psoriasis:

1. Topical medications: corticosteroids, calcipotriol, coal tar products, dithranol, and salicylic acid.
2. Oral or injected medications: to control inflammation and reduce scaling.
3. Light therapy: beneficial for scalp psoriasis alone or combined with topical medications.
4. Lifestyle changes: stress reduction, diet improvement, and regular exercise to reduce flare-ups.
5. Self-care measures: avoid scratching the scalp, and use gentle shampoos designed for scalp psoriasis.

# Trichotillomania

Trichotillomania, or hair-pulling disorder, is a psychological condition marked by a recurrent urge to pull out one's hair. This behavior can lead to noticeable hair thinning, patchy baldness, or even complete hair loss in severe cases.

# Symptoms of trichotillomania

Common symptoms associated with trichotillomania include:

* Obsessive thoughts or urges to pull out hair
* Feelings of tension before and relief after hair-pulling
* Frequent playing with, twirling, or rubbing pulled-out hair
* Inability to resist hair-pulling in specific situations or when experiencing certain emotions
* Noticeable bald patches on the scalp and other areas of the body
* Emotional distress related to hair-pulling, such as guilt or shame
* Excessive grooming behaviors leading to hair loss, such as over-combing or brushing
* Feelings of satisfaction when looking at pulled-out hair
* Using techniques to disguise bald patches, such as wearing hats or frequently changing hairstyles

# Recommended treatments for trichotillomania

1. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): helps identify and modify thoughts, feelings, and behaviors contributing to hair-pulling urges.
2. Medications: antidepressants or antipsychotics to reduce hair-pulling urges and relieve symptoms.
3. Habit Reversal Training (HRT): a type of CBT that helps identify and modify hair-pulling behaviors.
4. Support Groups: provide a safe place to share experiences, build coping skills, and reduce stigma.

# Female Pattern Baldness

Female pattern baldness, or androgenetic alopecia, is a common type of hair loss affecting millions of women worldwide. It usually begins in the 40s and can continue until menopause. The primary cause is an excess of androgens or male hormones, which causes hair follicles to shrink, leading to thinning hair on the scalp.

# Symptoms of female pattern baldness

Common signs and symptoms include:

* Gradual thinning on top of the head
* Receding hairline, especially at temples
* Widening of the center hair part
* Increased hair shedding on a pillow in the morning
* An overall decrease in scalp coverage
* Visible bald patches (in advanced cases)
* Hair shedding or breakage

# Recommended treatments for female pattern baldness

1. Medications: Finasteride (Propecia) and minoxidil (Rogaine) are commonly used to treat female pattern baldness. Finasteride blocks the conversion of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), while minoxidil promotes hair growth by increasing blood flow to the scalp.
2. Laser Therapy: Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) is a non-invasive treatment shown to reduce hair loss and promote new hair growth in some women. It uses low-intensity lasers to stimulate the scalp, increasing circulation and encouraging follicles to enter the anagen phase of the hair growth cycle.
3. Hair Transplant Surgery: This procedure involves transplanting healthy hair from an area of the scalp with thicker hair to balding areas. The transplanted hairs will grow naturally in the new location, providing a permanent solution to female pattern baldness.
4. Scandinavian Biolabs Hair Growth Routine: Designed to address early-stage non-scarring hair loss, including androgenetic alopecia, this natural hair growth solution harnesses the power of bioactive ingredients to help strengthen hair, reduce hair loss, and stimulate new growth. 

# Hairline recession &amp; thinning at the crown

Hairline recession and thinning at the crown can be distressing for many people, especially those who had a full head of hair in their younger years. This issue affects both men and women but is more common in men.

# Symptoms of hairline recession &amp; thinning at the crown

* Widening of the central and frontal hair part line
* Visible scalp on forehead, temples, or crown areas
* Reduced amount of hairs in specific areas
* An overall decrease in fullness and body of hair along the parting line
* Widening of the scalp line with a receding hairline
* Hair loss in patches, mainly on the crown area
* Breakage or shedding hairs along the parting lines or around the crown area

# Recommended Treatments for Hairline Recession &amp; Thinning at the Crown

1. Minoxidil: Minoxidil is a topical medication applied directly to the scalp, available in over-the-counter and prescription formulas. It stimulates hair growth and makes existing hairs stronger and thicker.
2. Finasteride: This medication is taken orally, usually once a day, and works to block the production of DHT (dihydrotestosterone), a significant contributing factor in male pattern baldness.
3. Platelet-rich Plasma Therapy: Platelet-rich plasma therapy (PRP) is a treatment that uses the patient's blood to stimulate hair growth. It injects the patient's plasma, containing high platelets and other healing factors, directly into the scalp.
4. Hair Transplant: A hair transplant is a surgical procedure that involves transferring hair follicles from one part of the scalp to another. It can treat hairline recession and thinning at the crown.
5. Laser Therapy: Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) is a newer form of treatment that uses light energy to stimulate hair growth. The lasers are typically painless and can treat both men and women experiencing hair loss.",https://www.reddit.com/r/malehairadvice/comments/12muvs1/a_more_practical_straightforward_hair_loss_guide/,20,2,0,self.malehairadvice

- “They created stagnant endless fights”

		

Aren’t large drawn-out fights exactly what this game advertises?  Nobody was forced to go to them, you could easily go around the Biolabs and cut them off.

- “Hardspawns are not real planetside because they don’t involve ‘logistics.’”



Then why did the Biolabs on Esamir get replaced with Containment sites with hardspawns?  Why do the Amerish amp stations have hardspawns?  Hardspawns in these bases make the fight WAY better than just having sundies.  

- “People just went to them to avoid vehicles”



And that’s a problem?  There are no vehicles inside of many bases in this game.  Why is it so offensive to have a base centered around infantry combat.  



I had lots of great Biolab fights before they were removed.  I’ve had almost no good fights at Biolabs since the removal.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/12kyegx/why_were_biolab_hardspawns_removed/,127,81,0,self.Planetside

I think this is when it became noticably bad. His feed is littered with hateful comments towards the LGBTQ+, the left in general, and whatever else the QAnon is rallying against these days. What stuck out to me this time was a meme he retweeted.

It was a comparison between journalists and conspiracy theorists and who was right about the listed subjects: vaccines being harmful, ivermecrin working, face masks being useless, ukraine biolabs (no clue what that's about, and I don't wanna know tbh) and other things. Some of it was really broad: child trafficking, lockdown, hunter's laptop. I'm pretty sure all of which journalists have reported on so idk what they're trying to say.

It's just sad to see someone who at one point in my life had been a role model. Now he's an angry, close-minded man who spends his days on Twitter cussing folks out and spitting angry rhetoric. It's as ironic as it is sad since he's a ""devote christian"". I'm not going back to that house, not even for my mom (who is probably also drinking the kool aid, just less of it). If he knew I were nonbinary, he'd shoot me without hesitation. I'm not going to be around someone who hates me on a fundamental level.

labrats,t5_2srnv,609761,PCR contamination is about to be my thirteenth reason.,https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/12e8xrf/pcr_contamination_is_about_to_be_my_thirteenth/,realmadastra,2023-04-07T03:56:53,"Alright, buckle up because I am about to detail every troubleshooting attempt I have made thus far. I am at the end of my tether and am coming up on about 7 months of working on this problem. 

I use universal 16S primers (V4 region) 515F (GTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA) and 806R (GGACTACNVGGGTWTCTAAT), and am having consistent contamination in my PCR negatives (no template). I spent a full year in another lab running the same protocol for PCR (although we amplified the V3-V4 region), and ran dozens with no contamination. In this new lab, I successfully ran a few PCRs over the course of several months before encountering this issue. The contamination I'm seeing is the same size as my positive control, but it's significantly fainter.

**--- Reagents and supplies ---**

1) Nuclease-free water from IDT (2 mL aliquots).

2) Q5 high-fidelity polymerase and buffer from new england biolabs.

3) dNTPS solution mix (they come pre-mixed)

4) Primers from IDT (they come diluted in IDTE buffer at 100x).

5) 2 mL sterile and DNA-free microcentrifuge tubes from Thermoscientific

6) 0.2 mL PCR tubes from axygen (DNase/RNase free)

7) Pre-racked filter tips from Gilson (these were non-sterile but DNA free, but I've also used sterile filter tips). 

**--- Protocol ---**

We use an airclean PCR workstation. 

1) Autoclave my sterile 2 mL and 0.2 mL microcentrifuge tubes.

2) Bleach workstation for 20-30 minutes, then wipe down with 70% ethanol twice. 

3) Wipe down supplies (tubes, tips, etc.) with 70% ethanol, add to the workstation and then UV for &gt;30 minutes. 

4) Set-up my reaction wearing dedicated lab coat. I make a mastermix for the number of reactions I'm setting up, so all reactions contain the same mastermix.

\--- **Troubleshooting ---**

1) Changed all my reagents (more than once). And I mean all my reagents.

2) Fully cleaned my pipettes (soaked bleachable parts in bleach then rinsed off with distilled water)

3) Have dedicated PCR set-up lab coat.

4) Stopped autoclaving microcentrifuge tubes and bought certified DNA-free tubes.

5) Only using pre-racked filter tips.

6) Tried setting-up reaction on an open bench in front of a flame (bunsen burner).

**--- Areas of concern ---**

1) I was recently informed that some lab members were purifying PCR products in the PCR workstation lol

2) Our gel station bench is opposite the PCR workstation - theoretically, this shouldn't matter given that the workstation should be filtering the air/creating a barrier.

3) A lab mate was working with soil samples in the lab (which is a big no-no since this is our 'clean' lab), so there's the potential that the air is contaminated with DNA.

4) I'm not 100% certain on whether to autoclave tubes or not - if my tubes are non-sterile but DNA-free should I still autoclave? Sometimes it's human DNA free, can I assume the process to make it human DNA free gets rid of all DNA?

5) I haven't tried using a different thermocycler.

6) I haven't tried setting it up in a different lab because there aren't really any labs with PCR workstations. And most labs work with some form of bacteria, so still a contamination risk.

7) We share an autoclave with labs who autoclave waste (including plates with growth etc.)

Things to note:

I don't share reagents or any other supplies with my lab mates. The only thing we share is the PCR workstation, the thermocycler, and gel station reagents/equipment.

My supervisor has come in several times, and they got a few clean results (I would do it right after them and also get clean results) - but then after I ran a few PCRs with clean results, I would get contamination again. My supervisor has now also starting getting contamination, even after using a new set of reagents. Some of the contamination has been inconsistent. Eg. my PCR negative will be contaminated but my sample (which also shouldn't have any DNA) will have no amplification - but how does my sample have no amplification, but my PCR negative does when I'm using the same mastermix??

Also my supervisor doesn't wear gloves (but they have gotten several clean results this way lmao).

My lab mates have gotten clean PCRs, but only when they use their fungal primers (which are also universal but for fungi, which is apparently harder to just get airborne contamination). I've been meaning to try with the fungal primers to see if I can also get clean results.

I am happy to answer more clarifying questions, I know this was a massive post but I am so beyond desperate at this point and appreciate anyone who made it this far.

Anyone involved, interested or invested in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has likely heard those words in that warm, welcoming Australian accent. Whether it’s a conflict update, vlog or a long form interview with a foreign fighter, Willy has produced some of the most original English-language reporting on Ukraine. A former soldier who was not long ago diagnosed with an incurable brain tumour, Willy is as inspirational as he is impressive. He differentiates himself from the mainstream media by his dogged pursuit of objectivity, while simultaneously admitting his fallibility. 

He positions himself as an anti-war arbiter of balance in a media space crowded by partisans, propaganda, trolls and bots. *“Guys, I don’t care which side you’re on, a war crime is a war crime”. “There is propaganda on both sides”. “There are war crimes on both sides”. “There are things that you wont necessarily agree with that are true”.* 

Such sentences litter his videos with an almost obsessive frequency, and nothing he is saying is wrong. In fact, most of these proclamations are so self-evident that they’re almost not worth saying. And this is also where Willy falters. The fallible white knight of independent journalism, on his obsessive crusade for balance and objectivity, is actually inadvertently damaging the very values he claims to uphold. And this goes beyond his acknowledged pessimism. As proffered by physicist Dr. David Grimes (Nov 2016), “The assumption that good journalism requires mutually opposed views to be treated as equally valid simply doesn’t hold”. Willy is constantly falling into the trap of so-called “false balance”.

According to the New York Times (2016), false balance, sometimes called ""false equivalency"" or “bothsidesism,” refers disparagingly to the practice of journalists who, in their zeal to be fair, present each side of a debate as equally credible, even when the factual evidence is stacked heavily on one side. A study by Northwestern University (2022), found that false balance, “can damage the public’s ability to distinguish fact from fiction and lead audiences to doubt the…consensus on pressing societal challenges”. One of the study’s coauthors, psychologist Dr. David Ramp, offers climate change as a good example, because the scientific consensus is nearly unanimous. “If 99 doctors said you needed surgery to save your life, but one disagreed, chances are you’d listen to the 99,” Rapp said. “But we often see one climate scientist pitted against one climate denier or down player on the news, as if it’s a 50-50 split.”

“When both sides of an argument are presented, people tend to have lower estimates about scientific consensus and seem to be less likely to believe climate change is something to worry about,” Rapp continued, adding that false balance creates doubt, confusion and a tendency to prefer the more placating option. This is wholly applicable to Willy’s journalism. He is constantly trying to provide balance, which is admirable if naive, but it is seldom analytically helpful because he often inadvertently provides false equivalence. Willy always talks about how there's propaganda on BOTH SIDES and war crimes on BOTH SIDES. But these equivalencies are flawed and misleading, because the scale of Russian war crimes, censorship and propaganda is just incomparable to that on the other side. 

If Russia commits 98% of war crimes in a war they started and Ukraine commits 2%, it is not objective or fair to give them 50/50 coverage. Genocide, hate speech, rape of Ukrainians as young as 4, illegal annexation of territory, beheading and shooting of POWs, torture, massacres and targeted killings of civilians, mass forced deportations, including of children who are subsequently re-educated (brainwashed) to erase their national memory. And the Ukrainians? One only needs to recall the outcry over the Amnesty International report to understand the ludicrousness of some of Willy’s statements. 

“What annoys me is that there is propaganda on BOTH sides"". Yes Willy, there is, but Russia’s state-controlled TV is talking about transexual satanic NATO super soldiers carrying slav-killing pathogens created in nazi-run biolabs and staging videos of Ukrainians bombing cities, while the British Sun is running a story about whether or not Putin “shat himself”. There is no equivalence. Drawing any is an insult to those suffering in this war or under Putin’s authoritarian regime. Willy is unwittingly acting out a page from the FSB’s misinformation handbook. At the start of the war, the Russian misinformation machine had the World talking about Ukrainian nationalism and rampant Naziism, while their soldiers were mindlessly killing Ukrainians on the streets of Bucha and other cities. The propaganda was bollocks, but the public nonetheless became fixated with it. It helped dilute and confuse opinion at a time where decisive action was needed. Luckily it did not work well enough, but it certainly helped Russia’s cause on the World stage at the time. When Russia’s actions in Ukraine are so deplorable, sometimes all they can hope for is to try level the playing field by highlighting bad things from the other side. Willy offers them that privilege much more often than they deserve. 

I shall end with a quote, followed by some examples of this discussion from one of Willy’s videos. “On matters of \[politics\]..desire to present all views equally can be a Trojan horse for damaging falsehoods..If one position is supported by an abundance of evidence whilst another is bereft of it, it is profoundly misguided to afford them equal air‐time. Responsibility for improving societal understanding is \[not to be confused with talking about both sides\]. If we are to stem the tide of misinformation, it is imperative that \[journalists\] themselves become more enmeshed in the communication of \[fact and reality\]. False balance is insidious, giving dubious positions an illusion of respectability......a Trojan horse that allows the most odious of fictions to gain a foothold. False balance creates a perception in the public mind that an issue is contentious, when it is not”.

Willy’s journalism may still be useful, interesting and enjoyable, but do listen out for - and call out - any false balance you hear. There are many Ukrainians who have long abandoned his content because of it. 

**APPENDIX A - EXAMPLES**

SOURCE: [youtube.com/watch?.](https://youtube.com/watch?.)..

In the text below \[FOBV\] stands for ‘fucking obvious’. I’ve used it to highlight any self-evident statements.

EX 1

1:37:51: Nucking Futs is talking about the brainwashing of Russians who believe that Ukraine is theirs. Willy responds as follows: “Something that annoys me is there’s things on both sides that can be, um, correct, that you dont need to agree with...”. \[FOBV\] He goes on to provide examples from…both sides…and how people think he’s either Kremlin or CIA plant…”no I’m just trying to take an objective view on something” etc. Nucking Futs brushes over what Willy said and goes back to what he was talking about.

This is an example of false balance / false equivalence. Willy took the conversation away from topic to give a self-evident proposition (that some things are true even though we don’t want them to be?), and provided (false) balance between Western and Russian brainwashing/propaganda.

EX 2

1:46:39 Nucking Futs finishes talking about Russia’s invasion of Georgia and its imperialist behaviour since the end of the CW. He rhetorically asks how the world would react if Finland decided it wanted to reclaim St. Petersberg, or China reclaim Vladivostok, or Mongolia the whole of Asia and Russia etc. Willy responds, “One of the big ones I do understand though is that…the idea of America getting away with so much shit”. He then says, “you can say two things are bad but you dont need to turn on your side” \[FOBV\]. He gives the example of people justifying Russia’s invasion of Ukraine because of America’s illegal invasion of Iraq - and says that you can condemn both \[FOBV\]. “And I see this everywhere, I see this on both sides”. Nucking Futs then brings the discussion back to Ukraine and Russia.

Willy is again bringing things back to “both sides”. His main proposition - that you can condemn an act irrespective of the actor - is again completely self-evident, or fucking obvious. However, by bringing up America as a counterweight, he is inadvertently creating the exact false balance that he is trying to avoid. Rather than an objective discussion about Russian imperialism and interventionism, Willy is needlessly doing the both sides dance.

EX 3

1:51:41 Nucking Futs has just finished talking about how he had a romanticised view of Russia and the Soviet Union while growing up, which was eventually shattered. He tries to head Willy off at the pass by giving the example of the U.S. fucking around in their back yard (central/South America) and how that was wrong, just like Russia trying to forcefully impose its will on former Warsaw pact / soviet bloc countries. After agreeing, Willy responds, “I’ve been very outspoken on my channel, um, completely saying how awful war crimes are \[FOBV\]…and how there are videos from both sides of executions, and I would never downplay that that happens”. “Now, of course, one side is responsible for a lot more than others, but either way, and I’m like no, any, that is a war crime, and I don’t care what uniform they’ve got on, I don’t care if they’ve got an Australian uniform on” \[FOBV\].

Here Willy is drawing false equivalence between Russian war crimes and Ukrainian war crimes, for no obvious reason. That war crimes are bad and happen on both sides is fucking obvious. Whilst he does restore some balance by saying that “one side \[without specifying which\] is responsible for a lot more than others”…he quickly gets back to his main thrust…which is the self-evident position that war crimes are bad no matter who conducts them. Cheers Willy, I thought Americans and Australian soldiers shooting Iraqis was fine, but now you’ve enlightened me. Russia is committing genocide in Ukraine, bombing civilians and their homes, forcefully deporting children, torturing and raping civilians, annexing land that isn’t theirs, beheading or dismembering Ukrainian soldiers, shooting POWs….but for Willy it is more important to provide balance by saying that both sides have conducted war crimes and both sides should be condemned for them. Do you see how this is false balance? Put yourself in the shoes of a Ukrainian when listening and it will become evident.

EX 4

1:53:50 Prompted by a question from Willy, Nucking Futs does a great segment talking about various Russian propaganda B.S. - Ukrainian nazis, staged incidents, no video or photographic evidence of the constant shelling of donetsk Russia claims occurs, and the latest alt right trope of saying the whole war is fake. Willy responds about how easy it is for people to be taken out of context \[FOBV\], and gives a funny story about how he was joking around with a friend on video calling each other nazis in Ukraine, and it got posted on some Russian telegram as if it was serious. “It’s so easy to take things out of context, and there is absolute propaganda on both sides of this, and journalists on both sides of this will completely ignore the facts and realities…”. He then carries on about how it’s great to be doing a long interview, and that people need to watch the entire thing and not quote clips that can be taken out of context.

Here he is providing false equivalence between the degree of propaganda from Russia (where you get put in Prison for speaking out against the war) and the West, where you are free to say whatever the fuck you want, including going on social media to worship Putin, call for Ukraine’s downfall as a fake Nazi biolab state, and pray for Trump’s coup d’etat. The example above is especially good, because it contrasts the extent to which he thinks he is being balanced and objective, with the false balance he inadvertently but nonetheless gives.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NonCredibleDefense/comments/128wbuw/ncd_journal_of_intelligence_journalism_and/,27,8,1,self.NonCredibleDefense
